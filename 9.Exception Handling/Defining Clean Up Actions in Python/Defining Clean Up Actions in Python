Think of a task you will always want your program to do, whether it runs perfectly or raise any kind of error.
For example, We use of try statement which has an optional clause – “finally” to perform clean up actions,
that must be executed under all conditions.


Cleanup actions: Before leaving the try statement, “finally” clause is always executed, whether any exception is raised or not.
These are clauses which are intended to define clean-up actions that must be executed under all circumstances.
Whenever an exception occurs and is not being handled by the except clause,
first finally will occur and then the error is raised as default [Code 3].
