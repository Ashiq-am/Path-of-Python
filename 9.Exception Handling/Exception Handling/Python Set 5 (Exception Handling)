We have explored basic python till now from Set 1 to 4
(Set 1 | Set 2 | Set 3 | Set 4).

If you are a beginner, then you might be getting a lot of Tracebacks till now.
The tracebacks are generated due to runtime errors.

Like other languages, python also provides the runtime errors via exception
handling method with the help of try-except.

Some of the standard exceptions which are most frequent include IndexError,
ImportError, IOError, ZeroDivisionError, TypeError.

Exception is the base class for all the exceptions in python. You can check the
exception hierarchy here.


Let us try to access the array element whose index is out of bound and handle the
corresponding exception.
