All instances in Python must be instances of a class that derives from BaseException.
Two exception classes that are not related via subclassing are never equivalent,
even if they have the same name.

The built-in exceptions can be generated by the interpreter or built-in functions.

There are several built-in exceptions in Python that are raised when errors occur.
These built-in exceptions can be viewed using the local() built-in functions as
follows :



>>> locals()['__builtins__']



This returns a dictionary of built-in exceptions, functions and attributes.
