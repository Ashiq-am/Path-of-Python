A 404 Error is showed whenever a page is not found.
Maybe the owner changed it’s URL and forgot to change the link or maybe they deleted the page itself.
Every site needs a Custom Error page to avoid the user to see the default Ugly Error page.


GeeksforGeeks also has a customized error page. If we type a URL like
www.geeksforgeeks.org/ajneawnewiaiowjf


It will show Error 404 page since this URL doesn’t exist. But an error page provides a beautiful layout,
helps the user to go back or even takes them to the homepage after a specific time interval.
That is why Custom Error pages are necessary for every website.

Flask provides us with a way to handle the error and return our Custom Error page.

For this, we need to download and import flask. Download flask through the following commands on CMD.


pip install flask


Using app.py as our Python file to manage templates, 404.html be the file we will return in the case of a 404 error and header.html be the file with header and navbar of a website.
