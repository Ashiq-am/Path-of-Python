Running your First Code in Python:

Python programs are not compiled, rather they are interpreted.
Now, let us move to writing a python code and running it.
Please make sure that python is installed on the system you are working.
If it is not installed, download it from here. We will be using python 2.7.




Making a Python file:

Python files are stored with the extension “.py”.
Open text editor and save a file with the name “hello.py”. Open it and write the following code:

print "Hello World"
# Notice that NO semi-colon is to be used












Reading the file contents:
Linux System – Move to the directory from terminal where the created file (hello.py) is stored by using the ‘cd’ command
and then type the following in the terminal :

python hello.py


Windows system – Open command prompt and move to the directory where the file is stored by using the ‘cd’ command
and then run the file by writing the file name as command.
