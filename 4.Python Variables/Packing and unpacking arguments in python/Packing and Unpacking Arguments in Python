We use two operators * (for tuples) and ** (for dictionaries).



Background :

Consider a situation where we have a function that receives four arguments.
We want to make call to this function and we have a list of size 4 with us that has all arguments for the function.
If we simply pass list to the function, the call doesn’t work.





Unpacking :

We can use * to unpack the list so that all elements of it can be passed as different parameters.






Packing :

When we don’t know how many arguments need to be passed to a python function,
we can use Packing to pack all arguments in a tuple.
