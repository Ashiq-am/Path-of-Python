In Python, there is no existence of “Private” instance variables which cannot be accessed except inside an object.
However, a convention is being followed by most Python code and coders i.e.,
a name prefixed with an underscore, For e.g. _geek should be treated as a non-public part of the API or
any Python code, whether it is a function, a method or a data member.

While going through this we would also try to understand the concept of various forms of trailing underscores,
for eg., for _ in range(10), __init__(self).
