In this article, we will see how can we use multiple .kv files in a single Application .

This is the Python program, which uses GridLayout as the root widget. In addition to the main kv file,
it loads box1.kv, box2.kv and box3.kv.
There are also 2 application variables. These variables are referenced from the main kv file.





Basic Approach:

1) import kivy
2) import kivyApp
3) import Gridlayout
4) import Builder
5) Set minimum version(optional)
6) Create Layout class
7) Create App class
8) Set up multiple .kv file
9) return Layout/widget/Class(according to requirement)
10) Run an instance of the class
