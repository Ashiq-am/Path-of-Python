Ellipse is a vertex canvas instruction. It allows drawing of a regular polygon, or an arc based on
them. In this article, we will see different polygons have different number of sides and
also many vertices on circle.

As in Kivy, we can make polygons based on an ellipse. Note, the angles in Kivy, are different than
those in math. In Kivy, the 0-degree point, corresponds to the 90 degree-point, in math.




Note:
These are the formulas for x and y. These math formulas assume the center is 0, 0.
Thus, after calculations are done, there has to be a translation by x of a and y of b.
The width is 2a, and height is 2b.


N segments = N vertices

1) angle[i]= i*360/n ; i=0 to n

2) x[i]=a cos(angle[i])

3) y[i]=b sin(angle[i])

4) In kivy 12’o clock is 0 degree and increases clockwise but in math 3’o clock is 0 degree increases
   counter clockwise.
