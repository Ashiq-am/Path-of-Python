In this we are going to see how can we create a stopwatch using label .
In the code i am creating just a counter using label in which when you set the time in seconds it
will start decreasing like a countdown and in the second we will do the same by using clock object.



Clock Object:
1) Kivy provides Clock objects.

2) Clock objects can be made to call a function when a specified time period has elapsed.

3) A clock object in Kivy can be configured to call a function upon every elapse of a time
    duration or only once.


          It is good to use kivy inbuilt module while working with clock:
                               [from kivy.clock import Clock]









Basic Approach:
1) import kivy
2) import kivyApp
3) import label
4) import Animation
5) Import clock
6) import kivy properties(only needed one)
7) Set minimum version(optional)
8) Create Label class
9) Create App class
10) return Layout/widget/Class(according to requirement)
11) Run an instance of the class
