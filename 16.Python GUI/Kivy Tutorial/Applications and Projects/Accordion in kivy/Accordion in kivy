The Accordion widget is a form of menu where the options are stacked either vertically or horizontally
and the item in focus (when touched) opens up to display its content.

It can contain many item instances, each of which should contain one root content widget.
You will end up like a tree.




The current implementation divides the AccordionItem into two parts:

1.One container for the title bar(made from kv templet)
2.One container for the content





You can increase the default size of the title bar:

[root = Accordion(min_space=60)]

               Or

change the orientation to vertical:

[root = Accordion(orientation=’vertical’)]












The AccordionItem is more configurable and you can set your own title background when the item is
collapsed or opened:

item = AccordionItem(background_normal=’image_when_collapsed.png’,
background_selected=’image_when_selected.png’)











Basic Approach:
1) import kivy
2) import kivyApp
3) import Accordian, AccordianItem
4) import Label
5) Create App class
6) return Layout/widget/Class(according to requirement)
7) Run an instance of the class
