VKeyboard is an onscreen keyboard for Kivy. Its operation is intended to be transparent to the user.
Using the widget directly is NOT recommended. Read the section Request keyboard first.



Modes in Vkeyboard:



This virtual keyboard has a docked and free mode:

**Docked mode: (VKeyboard.docked = True) Generally used when only one person is using the computer,
               like a tablet or personal computer etc.

**Free mode: (VKeyboard.docked = False) Mostly for multitouch surfaces. This mode allows multiple
             virtual keyboards to be used on the screen.


If the docked mode changes, you need to manually call VKeyboard.setup_mode() otherwise, the change
will have no impact.

During that call, the VKeyboard, implemented on top of a Scatter, will change the behavior of
the scatter and position the keyboard near the target (if target and docked mode are set).
