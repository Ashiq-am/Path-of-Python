Clock Object:

The Clock object allows you to schedule a function call in the future; once or repeatedly at specified
intervals.

You can get the time elapsed between the scheduling and the calling of the callback via the dt argument:






Note: If the callback returns False, the schedule will be canceled and wonâ€™t repeat.


In this we are going to create the kivy the stopwatch and we are creating 3 buttons in this which
are start, pause, resume.

[It is good to use kivy inbuilt module while working with clock and:

from kivy.clock import Clock]













Basic Approach:
1) import kivy
2) import kivyApp
3) import Builder
4) import Boxlayout
5) Import clock
6) import kivy properties(only needed one)
7) Set minimum version(optional)
8) Create the .kv code:
     1) Create Buttons
     2) Add call to button
     3) Add label
9) Create Layout class
10) Create App class
11) return Layout/widget/Class(according to requirement)
12) Run an instance of the class
