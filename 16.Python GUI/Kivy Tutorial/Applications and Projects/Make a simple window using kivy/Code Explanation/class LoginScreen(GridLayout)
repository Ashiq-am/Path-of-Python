***In this class, we made the grids and the blocks like username, password and provide the fuctionality of
text input. Letâ€™s see the detailed description now.

In the class LoginScreen, we override the method __init__() so as to add widgets and to define
their behavior.One should not forget to call super in order to implement the functionality of the
original class being
overloaded. Also note that it is good practice not to omit the **kwargs while calling super,
as they are sometimes used internally.








***We ask the GridLayout to manage its children in two columns and add a Label and a TextInput for
the username and password.
