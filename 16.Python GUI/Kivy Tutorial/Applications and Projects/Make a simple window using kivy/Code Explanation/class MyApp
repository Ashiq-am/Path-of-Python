**This class is derived from the App() class of the kivy.app. This class is the base class for creaking
the kivy Application. It is bassically the main entery point into the kivy run loop.

In most of the cases, we subclass this class and makes our own App. we create the instance of the
specific App() class, when we are ready to start, we call the instance App().run() method.

Here the build() method “Initializes the application; it will be called only once. If this method
returns a widget (tree), it will be used as the root widget and added to the window.

Returns:None or a root Widget instance if no self.root exists.”






**MyApp.run() is the run() method Launches the app in standalone mode and calls the class MyApp which
   returns the Loginscreen() class.
