The Accordion widget is a form of menu where the options are stacked either vertically or horizontally
and the item in focus (when touched) opens up to display its content.


It can contain many item instances, each of which should contain one root content widget.
Yow will be end up like a tree.





The current implementation divides the AccordionItem into two parts:

1.One container for the title bar(made from kv templet)
2.One container for the content











Basic Approach:
1) import kivy
2) import kivyApp
3) import Accordian
4) Set minimum version(optional)
5) Create Accordion class
6) Create App class
7) create .kv file (name same as the app class)
8) return Layout/widget/Class(according to requirement)
9) Run an instance of the class
