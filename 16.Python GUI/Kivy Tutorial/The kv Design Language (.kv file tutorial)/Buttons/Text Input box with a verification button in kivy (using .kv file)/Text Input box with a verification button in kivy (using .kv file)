In this article we will learn how we can add a button with the Text input in kivy using .kv file
in python just like the same we have in the input and submit button.

So to make this you firstly must know about Textinput widget and Button in kivy.




TextInput: The TextInput widget provides a box for editable plain text. Unicode, multiline,
           cursor navigation, selection and clipboard features are supported.


Button: The Button is a Label with associated actions that are triggered when the button is
        pressed (or released after a click/touch). We can add functions behind the button and style
        the button.
