In this article we will see that how can we can change the size and the position of button in kivy
python in kv file.





1.size : This is for static sizing of widgets and takes two arguments i.e. (width, height).
       Default size of the button = (100, 100).



Syntax: b1 = Button(size=(100, 100))





2.pos : This is for static placement of widgets and is used to give position to button and by default
      it is (0, 0) which is the bottom-left corner of the screen.



Syntax : b1 = Button(pos=(100, 100))





3.size_hint : This is for dynamic sizing of the button and provide hint of size. It contains two
         arguments i.e. width and height it can be floating values.By default, all widgets have their
         size_hint=(1, 1).







4.pos_hint : This is for dynamic placement of the button and provide hint of position. We can
             define upto 8 keys i.e. it takes arguments in form of dictionary.

                 pos_hint = {“x”:1, “y”:1, “left”:1, “right”:1, “center_x”:1,
                                      “center_y”:1, “top”:1, “bottom”:1(“top”:0)}










Basic Approach:

1) import kivy
2) import kivyApp
3) import all neaded(like button and layouts to use them)
4) Set minimum version(optional)
5) create Layout class
6) create App class
7) Set up .kv file : Create the buttons and set up the position and size
8) return Layout/widget/Class(according to requirement)
9) Run an instance of the class
