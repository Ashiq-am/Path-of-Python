In this article we will going to learn how to round the button corners in kivy using .kv file in Python.

Widgets are always rectangle, but we can change the background of widgets and put couple of images
for the normal and the down state of the button by using some properties of buttons like
background_normal and background_down properties respectively.

Also, to round the corners of the button you also must have understand one more property of
button that is the border property.









background_down :
1) Background image of the button used for the default graphical representation when the button is
   pressed.
2) background_down is a StringProperty .



background_normal :
1) Background image of the button used for the default graphical representation when the button
   is not pressed.
2) background_normal is also a StringProperty



border :
1) Border used for BorderImage graphics instruction. Used with background_normal and background_down.
    Can be used for custom backgrounds.
2) It must be a list of four values: (bottom, right, top, left).
3) border is a ListProperty and defaults to (16, 16, 16, 16)
















Basic Approach:

1) import kivy
2) import kivyApp
3) import button and floatlayout
4) set minimum version(optional)
5) Create the Layout class
6) Create App class
7) Create .kv file:
          1) Add Base class
          2) Add Button properties
          3) Add Image as button
          4) Round the corners of the button using border property
8) return instance of the layout class
9) Run an instance of the class
