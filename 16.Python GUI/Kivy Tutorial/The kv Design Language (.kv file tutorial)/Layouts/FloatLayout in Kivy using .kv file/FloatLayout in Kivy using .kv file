Floatlayout provides us the flexibility to arrange the elements like button relatively i.e it allows
us to place the elements using something called relative position.
This means rather than defining the specific position or the coordinates we will place everything
using the percentage w.r.t the size of window i.e we can dynamically arrange the position of the
elements.





The first thing we need to do import FloatLayout –

[from kivy.uix.floatlayout import FloatLayout]








We have 2 properties to create the dynamic placement –

1) pos_hint: provide hint of position
We can define upto 6 keys i.e. it takes arguments in form of dictionary.
pos_hint = {“x”:1, “y”:1, “left”:1, “right”:1, “top”:1, “bottom”:1}

2) size_hint: provide hint of size
Contains two arguments i.e. width and height












Note:

1.You can only use values between 0-1 for both size_hint and pos_hint. Where 0 = 0% and 1 = 100%.

2.The coordinate system in kivy works from the bottom left! This will be important when placing our
   objects. (i.e (0, 0) is the bottom left).











Basic Approach:

1) import kivy
2) import kivyApp
3) import Floatlayout
4) Set minimum version(optional)
5) create Layout class
6) create App class
7) Set up .kv file
8) return Layout/widget/Class(according to requirement)
9) Run an instance of the class
