The PageLayout works in a different manner from other layouts. It is a dynamic layout, in the sense
that it allows flipping through pages using its borders.

The idea is that its components are stacked in front of each other, and we can just see the one that
is on top.
PageLayout is similar to pages of a copy like that we can move/change the pages right or left.



The PageLayout class is used to create a simple multi-page layout, in a way that allows easy
flipping from one page to another using border.


To use PageLayout you have to import it by the below command:

[from kivy.uix.pagelayout import PageLayout]
