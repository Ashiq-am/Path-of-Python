1.This layout operates in the same way as FloatLayout does, but the positioning properties
  (x, y, center_x, right, y, center_y, and top) are relative to the Layout size and not the window size.

2.In reality regardless of absolute and relative positioning, the widgets are moved when the position
  of the layout changes.

3.The available pos_hint keys (x, center_x, right, y, center_y, and top) are useful for aligning to
  edges or centering.




For example:

pos_hint: {‘center_x’:.5, ‘center_y’:.5} would align a Widget in the middle, no matter what the
           size of the window is.








The first thing we need to do to use a RelativeLayout is import it.

[from kivy.uix.relativelayout import RelativeLayout]










We can do relative positioning by:
pos_hint: provide hint of position.


We can define upto 8 keys i.e. it takes arguments in form of dictionary.
pos_hint = {“x”:1, “y”:1, “left”:1, “right”:1, “center_x”:1, “center_y”:1, “top”:1, “bottom”:1(“top”:0)}
