The Canvas is the root object used for drawing by a Widget. A kivy canvas is not the place where you
paint.

Each Widget in Kivy already has a Canvas by default. When you create a widget, you can create all the
instructions needed for drawing.

If self is your current widget. The instructions Color and Rectangle are automatically added to
the canvas object and will be used when the window is drawn.



To use Canvas you must have to import:

[from kivy.graphics import Rectangle, Color]







Basic Approach -
-> import kivy
-> import kivy App
-> import widget
-> import Canvas i.e.:
      from kivy.graphics import Rectangle, Color
-> set minimum version(optional)
-> Extend the Widget class
-> Create the App Class
-> create the .kv file:
    -> create the canvas
    -> Add action/callback if needeed
-> return a Widget
-> Run an instance of the class
