The Carousel widget provides the classic mobile-friendly carousel view where you can swipe between
slides.
You can add any content to the carousel and have it move horizontally or vertically.
The carousel can display pages in a sequence or a loop.


To work with this widget you must have to import:

[from kivy.uix.carousel import Carousel]






Basic Approach:
1) import kivy
2) import kivy App
3) import Gridlayout
4) import Carousel
5) set minimum version(optional)
6) Create as much as widget class as needed
7) create the App class
8) return the widget/layout etc class
9) Create Carousel.kv file:
        1) Create button( or what is needed)
        2) Arrange the on_release / on_press function
10) Run an instance of the class















In the below example we are creating the buttons in the App. In this we used load_previous() and
load_next() functions.



load_next(mode=’next’)
Animate to the next slide.

load_previous()
Animate to the previous slide.
