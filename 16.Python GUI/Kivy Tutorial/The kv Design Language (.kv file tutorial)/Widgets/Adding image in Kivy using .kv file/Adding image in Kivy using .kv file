The Image widget is used to display an image. To use the image widget you must have to import :


[from kivy.uix.image import Image, AsyncImage (not necessary while working with .kv file)]


because the module kivy.uix.image have all the functionality related to images.




Images can be loaded to the Application via two types:

1) Synchronous Loading: Loading image from the system (must be from the folder in which .py and
                        .kv file is saved)

2) Asynchronous Loading: To load an image asynchronously (for example from an external webserver)








Note: By default, the image is centered and fits inside the widget bounding box. If you donâ€™t want that,
      you can set allow_stretch to True and keep_ratio to False.














Basic Approach to create multiple layout in one file:
1) import kivy
2) import kivyApp
3) import image
4) import BoxLayout
5) set minimum version(optional)
6) Create the Layout class
7) Create App class
8) Create .kv file:
          1) Add BoxLayout
          2) Add Label
          3) Add Image
          4) Resizing, Positioning etc of Image
9) return instance of the layout class
10) Run an instance of the class
