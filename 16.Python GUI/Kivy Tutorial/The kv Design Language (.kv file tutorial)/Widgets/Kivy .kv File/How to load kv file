There are 2-ways to load the .kv file into code or Application



1.By name convention method-

While writing code we will make the App class. For this method, the name of the file and the app
class is same and save the kv file with appclassname.kv.
Kivy looks for a Kv file with the same name as your App class in lowercase, minus “App” if it ends
with ‘App’ e.g:

[classnameApp ---> classname.kv]


If this file defines a Root Widget it will be attached to the App’s root attribute and used as the
base of the application widget tree.








2.Builder method-
For this method to use you first have to import Builder by writing

[from kivy.lang import builder]



Now by the builder you can directly load the whole file as a string or as a file. By doing this
for loading .kv file as a file:

[Builder.load_file('.kv/file/path')]

or, for loading, kv file as a string:

[Builder.load_string(kv_string)]
