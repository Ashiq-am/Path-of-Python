As when we write the application in Python kivy, to write all the things on the same code make a
mess in the code and it is hard to understand that by someone another.
Also writing a large code makes hard to maintain the construction of the widget tree and explicit
the declaration of bindings.



The KV language, allows us to create own widget tree in a declarative way and to bind the widget
properties to each other or to callbacks in a natural way.
