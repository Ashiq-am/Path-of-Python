The Switch widget is active or inactive, as a mechanical light switch. The user can swipe to the
left/right to activate/deactivate it.

The value represented by the switch is either True or False. That is the switch can be either in On
position or Off position.



To work with Switch you must have to import:

[from kivy.uix.switch import Switch]










Attaching Callback to Switch:

**A switch can be attached with a call back to retrieve the value of the switch.

**The state transition of a switch is from either ON to OFF or OFF to ON.

**When switch makes any transition the callback is triggered and new state can be retrieved i.e
  came and any other action can be taken based on the state.

**By default, the representation of the widget is static. The minimum size required is 83*32 pixels.

**The entire widget is active, not just the part with graphics. As long as you swipe over the
  widgetâ€™s bounding box, it will work.












Basic Approach:

1) import kivy
2) import kivyApp
3) import Switch
4) import Gridlayout
5) import Label
6) Set minimum version(optional)
7) create Layout class(In this you create a switch):
        --> define the callback of the switch in this
8) create App class
9) create .kv file (name same as the app class):
        1) create boxLayout
        2) Give Lable
        3) Create Switch
        4) Bind a callback if needed
10) return Layout/widget/Class(according to requirement)
11) Run an instance of the class
