You have multiple transitions available by default, such as:


NoTransition – switches screens instantly with no animation


SlideTransition – slide the screen in/out, from any direction



CardTransition – new screen slides on the previous or the old one slides off the new one depending
                on the mode



SwapTransition – implementation of the iOS swap transition



FadeTransition – shader to fade the screen in/out



WipeTransition – shader to wipe the screens from right to left




FallOutTransition – shader where the old screen ‘falls’ and becomes transparent, revealing the new
                    one behind it.



RiseInTransition – shader where the new screen rises from the screen centre while fading from
                   transparent to opaque.












You can easily switch transitions by changing the ScreenManager.transition property:

[sm = ScreenManager(transition=FadeTransition())]
