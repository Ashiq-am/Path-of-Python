To use popup you must have to import :

[from kivy.uix.popup import Popup]




The Popup widget is used to create popups. By default, the popup will cover the whole “parent” window.
When you are creating a popup, you must at least set a Popup.title and Popup.content.

Keep one thing in mind that the default size of a widget is size_hint=(1, 1).
If you don’t want your popup to be on the full screen you must gave either size hints with values
less than 1 (for instance size_hint=(.8, .8)) or deactivate the size_hint and use fixed size
attributes.










Note:

Popup is a special widget. Don’t try to add it as a child to any other widget. If you do,
Popup will be handled like an ordinary widget and won’t be created hidden in the background, like:


                                    BoxLayout:
                                       MyPopup: # bad !
