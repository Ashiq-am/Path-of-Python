Animation and AnimationTransition are used to animate Widget properties.
You must specify at least a property name and target value. To use Animation, follow these steps:

***Setup an Animation object
***Use the Animation object on a Widget




To use animation you must have to import:

[from kivy.animation import Animation]









Basic Approaches:

1) import runTouchApp
2) import Builder
3) import Widget
4) import Animation
5) import Clock
6) import Window
7) import random
8) import listproperty
9) Build the .kv file
10) Create root class
11) Create the clock and anim react class used to animate the boxes
12) Run the App













In the below example we are creating the two boxes (red and green) in which we are giving animations
to the red box i.e when the App starts the red box is in its animated view but to clear the concepts
i am providing the green box which on click provide random animations i.e it goes anywhere at random.


The program consists of two main classes first is clock class which is for the red box as we are
declaring it animated and the green box animation is in anim class.
