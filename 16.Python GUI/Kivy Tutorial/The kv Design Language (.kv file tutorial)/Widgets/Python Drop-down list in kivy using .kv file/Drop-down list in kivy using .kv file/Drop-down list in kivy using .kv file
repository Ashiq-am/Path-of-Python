A drop-down list can be used with custom widgets. It allows you to display a list of widgets under
a displayed widget.

Unlike other toolkits, the list of widgets can contain any type of widget: simple buttons, images etc.

The positioning of the drop-down list is fully automatic: we will always try to place the dropdown
list in a way that the user can select an item in the list.





To work with this widget you must have to import:

[from kivy.uix.dropdown import DropDown]










Basic Approach:
1) import kivy
2) import kivyApp
3) import dropdown
4) import Floatlayout(according to need)
5) Set minimum version(optional)
6) Create Layout class
7) Create App class
9) create .kv file (name same as the app class):
        1) create Dropdown
        2) create callback
        3) And many more styling as needed
10) return Layout/widget/Class(according to requirement)
11) Run an instance of the class
