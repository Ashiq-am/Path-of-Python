The Switch widget is active or inactive, as a mechanical light switch. The user can swipe to the
left/right to activate/deactivate it.
The value represented by the switch is either True or False.
That is the switch can be either in On position or Off position.



To work with Switch you must have to import:

[from kivy.uix.switch import Switch]



Note: If you want to control the state with a single touch instead of a swipe, use the ToggleButton
instead.




Basic Approach:

1) import kivy
2) import kivyApp
3) import Switch
4) import Gridlayout
5) import Label
6) Set minimum version(optional)
7) create Layout class(In this you create a switch)
8) create App class
9) return Layout/widget/Class(according to requirement)
10) Run an instance of the class
