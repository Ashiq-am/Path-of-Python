Classical user interface widgets, ready to be assembled to create more complex widgets.
There are multiple UX Widgets such as Label, Button, CheckBox, Image, Slider, Progress Bar,
Text Input, Toggle button, Switch.





1.Label: The Label widget is for rendering text. It supports ascii and unicode strings.



2.Button: The Button is a Label with associated actions that are triggered when the button is pressed
          (or released after a click/touch).




3.CheckBox: CheckBox is a specific two-state button that can be either checked or unchecked.




4.Image: The Image widget is used to display an image.




5.Slider: The Slider widget looks like a scrollbar. It supports horizontal and vertical orientations,
          min/max values and a default value.




6.Progress Bar: ProgressBar widget is used to visualize the progress of some task.




7.TextInput: The TextInput widget provides a box for editable plain text.




8.Toggle Button: The ToggleButton widget acts like a checkbox. When you touch or click it, the state
toggles between ‘normal’ and ‘down’ (as opposed to a Button that is only ‘down’ as long as it is pressed).




9.Switch: The Switch widget is active or inactive, like a mechanical light switch.
