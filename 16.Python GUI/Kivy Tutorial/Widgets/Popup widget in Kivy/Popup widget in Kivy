1.The Popup widget is used to create popups. By default, the popup will cover the whole “parent” window.
   When you are creating a popup, you must at least set a Popup.title and Popup.content.


2.Popup dialogs are used ]when we have to convey certain obvious messages to the user.
  Messages to the user through status bars as well for specific messages which need to be told with
  emphasis can still be done through popup dialogs.




3.Keep one thing in mind that the default size of a widget is size_hint=(1, 1).



4.If you don’t want your popup to be on the full screen you must gave either size hints with values
  less than 1 (for instance size_hint=(.8, .8)) or deactivate the size_hint and
  use fixed size attributes.





To use popup you must have to import :



[from kivy.uix.popup import Popup]







Note: Popup is a special widget. Don’t try to add it as a child to any other widget.
If you do, Popup will be handled like an ordinary widget and won’t be created hidden in the background.



Basic Approach :

1) import kivy
2) import kivyApp
3) import Label
4) import button
5) import Gridlayout
6) import popup
7) Set minimum version(optional)
8) create App class
9) return Layout/widget/Class(according to requirement)
10) In the App class create the popup
11) Run an instance of the class
