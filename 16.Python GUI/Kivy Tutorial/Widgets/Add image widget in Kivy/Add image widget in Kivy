The Image widget is used to display an image. To use the image widget you must have to import :



[from kivy.uix.image import Image, AsyncImage]



because the module kivy.uix.image have all the functionality related to images.



Images can be loaded to the Application via two types:

1) From system :
wimg = Image(source='mylogo.png')

2) Asynchronous Loading:
To load an image asynchronously (for example from an external webserver), use the AsyncImage subclass:
aimg = AsyncImage(source='http://mywebsite.com/logo.png')









Note: By default, the image is centered and fits inside the widget bounding box.
If you donâ€™t want that, you can set allow_stretch to True and keep_ratio to False.


Basic Approach to create multiple layout in one file:
1) import kivy
2) import kivyApp
3) import image
4) set minimum version(optional)
5) create App class
6) return Image/layout/widget
7) Run an instance of the class
