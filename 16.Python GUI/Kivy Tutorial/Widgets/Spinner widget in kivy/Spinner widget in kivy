To work with spinner you must have to import:


[from kivy.uix.spinner import Spinner]



Spinner is a widget that provides a quick way to select one value from a set.
In the default state, a spinner shows its currently selected value. Touching the spinner displays a
dropdown menu with all the other available values from which the user can select a new one.

Like a combo box, a spinner object can have multiple values and one of the values can be selected.
A callback can be attached to the spinner object to receive notifications on selection of a value from
the spinner object.
