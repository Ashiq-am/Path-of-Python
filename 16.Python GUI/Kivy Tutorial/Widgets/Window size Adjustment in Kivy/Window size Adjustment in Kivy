In this article, we are going to see three formats of resizing the window size in kivy.

Note: Just note the size in the outputs of the window and check the minimize and maximize button on
window when it is visible or when not visible.


For resizing window we have:

[from kivy.config import Config]




Kivy has a configuration file which determines the default settings. In order to change these settings,
you can alter this file manually or use the Config object.
Configuration options control the initialization of the App. In order to avoid situations where the
config settings do not work or are not applied before window creation
(like setting an initial window size),
Config.set should be used before importing any other Kivy modules.

Ideally, this means setting them right at the start of your main.py script.
