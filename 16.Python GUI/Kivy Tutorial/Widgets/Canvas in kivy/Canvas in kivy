The Canvas is the root object used for drawing by a Widget . A kivy canvas is not the place where you
paint. The major problems I had at the beginning with the canvas were due to its name.
Particularly considering all the buzz about HTML5 canvas.
I initially think that the canvas is the paint But canvas is basically a container of instructions.




To use Canvas you must have to import:

            from kivy.graphics import Rectangle, Color


"""Note: Each Widget in Kivy already has a Canvas by default. When you create a widget,
you can create all the instructions needed for drawing. If self is your current widget.
The instructions Color and Rectangle are automatically added to the canvas object and will be used
when the window is drawn."""





Basic Approach
-> import kivy
-> import kivy App
-> import widget
-> import Canvas i.e.:
      from kivy.graphics import Rectangle, Color
-> set minimum version(optional)
-> Extend the Widget class
-> Create the App Class
-> return a Widget
-> Run an instance of the class
