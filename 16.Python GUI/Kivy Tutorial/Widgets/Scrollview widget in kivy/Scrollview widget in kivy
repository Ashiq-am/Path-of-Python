The ScrollView widget provides a scrollable/pannable viewport that is clipped at the scrollviewâ€™s
bounding box.



Scroll view accepts only one child and applies a window to it according to 2 properties:
1) scroll_x
2) scrool_y





To determine if interaction is a scrolling gesture, these properties are used:

     ****scroll_distance: the minimum distance to travel, defaults to 20 pixels.
     ****scroll_timeout: the maximum time period, defaults to 55 milliseconds.




Note:
To use the scrollview you must have to import it:

[from kivy.uix.scrollview import ScrollView]






Basic Approach:
1) import kivy
2) import kivyApp
3) import scroll view
4) import string property
5) Set minimum version(optional)
6) create the scroll view class
7) Build the .kv file within the .py file
8) Run an app
