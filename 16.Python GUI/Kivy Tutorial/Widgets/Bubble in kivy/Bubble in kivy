The Bubble widget is a form of menu or a small popup where the menu options are stacked either
vertically or horizontally. The Bubble contains an arrow pointing in the direction you choose.



To choose the direction in which arrow points use:

[Bubble(arrow_pos=’top_mid’)]




The orientation of the bubble is by default horizontally but you can change it by the command:

[orientation = ‘vertical’]





To add items to the bubble:

[bubble = Bubble(orientation = ‘vertical’)
bubble.add_widget(your_widget_instance)]





To remove items:

[bubble.remove_widget(widget)
or
bubble.clear_widgets()]
