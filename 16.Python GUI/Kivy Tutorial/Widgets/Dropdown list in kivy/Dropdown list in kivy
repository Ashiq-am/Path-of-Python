A dop-down list can be used with custom widgets. It allows you to display a list of widgets under a
displayed widget.

Unlike other toolkits, the list of widgets can contain any type of widget: simple buttons, images etc.



The positioning of the drop-down list is fully automatic: we will always try to place the dropdown
list in a way that the user can select an item in the list.



Some important points to keep in mind while making a drop-down list:


1.When adding widgets, we need to specify the height manually (disabling the size_hint_y) so the
dropdown can calculate the area it needs.



2.All the buttons within the dropdown list will trigger the dropdown DropDown.select() method.
After being called, the main button text will display the selection of the dropdown.




To work with this widget you must have to import:

[from kivy.uix.dropdown import DropDown]







Basic Approach:
1) import kivy
2) import kivy App
3) import dropdown list
4) import button
5) set minimum version(optional)
6) import runTouchApp
7) Create dropdown
8) create runtouchApp method
   which takes widget as an argument
   to run the App
