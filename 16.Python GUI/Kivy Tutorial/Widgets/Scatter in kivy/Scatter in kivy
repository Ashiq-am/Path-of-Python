Scatter is used to build interactive widgets that can be translated, rotated and scaled with two or
more fingers on a multitouch system.



It contains its own matrix transformations. The Scatter class allows a user to drag, scale, and rotate
any widget, which is under its control.


Just like in Relativelayout, the children are positioned relative to the scatter.
So when dragging the scatter, the position of the children donâ€™t change, only the position of
the scatter does.

The scatter size has no impact on the size of its children. If you want to resize it you can use scale,
which transform both the scatter and its children but does not change size.
