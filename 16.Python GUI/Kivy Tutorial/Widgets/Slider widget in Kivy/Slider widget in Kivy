To work with the slider you first have to import the module which consists all featuers, functions of
the slider i.e.



[Module: kivy.uix.slider]



The Slider widget looks like same we are using in android to increase the brightness, volume etc.
It supports horizontal and vertical orientations, min/max values and a default value.
Kivy supports several slider widget options for customizing the cursor, cursor image, border, background
to be used in different orientations, region between the minimum value and the maximum value.

Kivy also supports to deal in term of Normalized value (range 0 to 1) rather than the real ranges
supported by the slider.
