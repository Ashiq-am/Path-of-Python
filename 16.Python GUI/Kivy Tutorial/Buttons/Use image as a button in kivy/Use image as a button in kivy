To learn about it you must be aware about some properties, that are –



background_down :
1) Background image of the button used for the default graphical representation when the button is pressed.
2) background_down is a StringProperty .





background_normal :
1) Background image of the button used for the default graphical representation when the button is
   not pressed.
2) background_normal is also a StringProperty .





background_disabled_normal :
1) Background image of the button used for the default graphical representation when the button
   is disabled and not pressed.
2) background_disabled_normal is also a StringProperty .







Notes :
1) Now its only sufficient to understand that string property means they only take values in string
   that means like background_down: “normal.png” like this.
2) On click on the image it looks same like a simple button (as we uses it in a button).











Basic Approach  :

-> import kivy
-> import kivy App
-> import button
-> set minimum version(optional)
-> Extend the class :
              -> create an image a  button
              -> Do styling
              -> Arrange call back if needed
-> Add and return a button
-> Run an instance of the class
