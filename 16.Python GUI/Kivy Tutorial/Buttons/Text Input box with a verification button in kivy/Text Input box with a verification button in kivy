TextInput: The TextInput widget provides a box for editable plain text. Unicode, multiline, cursor
           navigation, selection and clipboard features are supported.



Button: The Button is a Label with associated actions that are triggered when the button is
        pressed (or released after a click/touch). We can add functions behind the button and
        style the button.
