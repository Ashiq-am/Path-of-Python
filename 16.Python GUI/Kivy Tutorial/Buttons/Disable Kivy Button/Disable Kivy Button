The Button is a Label with associated actions that are triggered when the button is pressed
(or released after a click/touch).

We can add functions behind the button and style the button.
But to disable the button we have a property name :


[disabled that must be true]



this property will help in disabling the button i.e. button will be there but is of no use as it is
disabled no functionality of button will work.


Note: disabled property was introduced in version 1.8.0. If you want to use it you need to actualize
your framework.






Basic Approach to follow while creating and disabling button :

-> import kivy
-> import kivy App
-> import button
-> set minimum version(optional)
-> Extend the class
-> Add and return a button
-> Add disabled = true to disable button
-> Run an instance of the class
