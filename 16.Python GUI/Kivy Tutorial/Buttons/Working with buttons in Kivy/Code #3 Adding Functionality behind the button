One of the common problems is how to add functionality to the button. So to add functionality we use
bind() function it binds the function to the button. bind() creates an event that is send to callback().

One of the most common problems for new Kivy users is misunderstanding how the bind method works,
especially amongst newer Python users who haven’t fully formed their intuition about function calls.

The thing is that the bind method doesn’t know about the existence of a function or its arguments,
it only receives the result of this function call.

As in the given code when the button is pressed it prints that “button pressed” def in the function
callback.

In the given code inside bind() we use on_press because when button press it tells the function that
button is pressed then the bind uses its functionality.
