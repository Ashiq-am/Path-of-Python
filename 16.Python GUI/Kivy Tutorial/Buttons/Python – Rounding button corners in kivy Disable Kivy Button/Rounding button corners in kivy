Basically this is the tricky one. As we know Widgets are always rectangle, but we can change the
background of widgets and put couple of images for the normal and the down state of the button by
using some properties of buttons like background_normal and background_down properties respectively.

Also to round the corners of the button you also must have understand one more property of button that
is the border property.





background_down :
1) Background image of the button used for the default graphical representation when the button is pressed.
2) background_down is a StringProperty .





background_normal :
1) Background image of the button used for the default graphical representation when the button is
   not pressed.
2) background_normal is also a StringProperty







border :
1) Border used for BorderImage graphics instruction. Used with background_normal and background_down.
   Can be used for custom backgrounds.
2) It must be a list of four values: (bottom, right, top, left).
3) border is a ListProperty and defaults to (16, 16, 16, 16)
