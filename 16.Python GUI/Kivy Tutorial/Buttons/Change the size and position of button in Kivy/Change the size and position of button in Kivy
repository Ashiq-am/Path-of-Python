In this article, we will see that how can we can change the size and the position of button in
kivy Python.

There are 4 properties to set up, the size and position of button. There are 2 properties which are
for static placement and another 2 are for dynamic placement.




1.size : It takes two arguments i.e. (width, height).







2.pos : pos stands for position i.e it is used to position the widget. By default (0, 0),
      the bottom-left corner of the screen is the default position of the button in kivy python.







3.size_hint : Provide hint of size. It contains two arguments i.e. width and height it can be floating
values. By default, all widgets have their size_hint=(1, 1). To create a button 50% of the width and
25% of the height of the layout and positioned at (20, 20)





4.pos_hint : Provide hint of position. We can define upto 8 keys i.e. it takes arguments in form of
dictionary.

[pos_hint = {“x”:1, “y”:1, “left”:1, “right”:1, "center_x":1,
                "center_y":1, "top”:1, “bottom”:1("top":0)}]



If you want to create a button that will always be the size of layout minus 20% on each side – see example
