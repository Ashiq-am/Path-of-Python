Now the Coulums represent the width and the rows represents the hight just like matrix.

1.Initial the size is given by the col_default_width and row_default_height properties.
We can force the default size by setting the col_force_default or row_force_default property.
This will force the layout to ignore the width and size_hint properties of children and use the
default size.



2.To customize the size of a single column or row, use cols_minimum or rows_minimum.




3.It is not necessary to give both rows and columns, it depends on the requirement. We can provide
either both or anyone accordingly.
