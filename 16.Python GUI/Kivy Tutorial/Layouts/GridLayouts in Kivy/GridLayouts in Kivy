Gridlayout is the function which creates the children and arrange them in a matrix format.
It takes the available space(square) and divides that space into rows and columns then add the widgets
accordingly to the resulting cells or grids.

We can not explicitly place the widgets in a particular column/row. Each child is assigned a particular
position automatically determined by the layout configuration and the child index in children list.

A gridlayout must contain at least on input constraints i.e. cols and rows.
If we do not specify the cols or rows to it, the layout gives you an exception.
