It is quite confusing to understand the difference between Stack and Boxlayout.
StackLayout can organize widgets with more complexity than BoxLayout Boxlayout can organize widgets
either in a vertical or horizontal way.
But with the StackLayout, you can combine the orientations.
There are 4 row-wise and 4 column wise orientations.



More flexible that Boxlayout(1D)

StackLayout Orientation (2D):
 - right to left or left to right
 - top to bottom or bottom to top
 - 'rl-bt', 'rl-tb', lr-bt', 'lr-tb'(Row wise)
 - 'bt-rl', 'bt-lr', 'tb-rl', 'tb-lr'(Column wise)
