Floatlayout allows us to place the elements relatively based on the current window size and
height especially in mobiles i.e.

Floatlayout allow us to place the elements using something called relative position.
This means rather than defining the specific position or the coordinates we will place everything using
the percentage w.r.t the size of window.

When we change the dimensions of the window everything placed in the window will adjust its size and
position accordingly. This makes the Application more reliable and scaleable to window size.




Note: FloatLayout honors the pos_hint and the size_hint properties of its children.

The first thing we need to do to use a FloatLayout is import it.

[from kivy.uix.floatlayout import FloatLayout]







For example, a FloatLayout with a size of (300, 300) is created:

[layout = FloatLayout(size=(300, 300))]



By default, all widgets have their size_hint = (1, 1), so this below button will adopt the same size as
the layout:

[button = Button(text='Hello world')
layout.add_widget(button)]
