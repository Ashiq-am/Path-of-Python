1.Relative layout is just similar to the FloatLayout the difference is that its child widget are
  positioned relative to the layout.





2.This layout operates in the same way as FloatLayout does, but the positioning properties
   (x, y, center_x, right, y, center_y, and top) are relative to the Layout
    size and not the window size.





3.In reality regardless of absolute and relative positioning, the widgets are moved when the
   position of the layout changes.





4.When the widget with position=(0, 0) is added to RelativeLayout, Now if the position of RelativeLayout
   is changed the child widget will also move.
   The Child widget coordinates remains same i.e (0, 0) as they are always relative to the parent
   layout.






5.The available pos_hint keys (x, center_x, right, y, center_y, and top) are useful for aligning
   to edges or centering.












For example:
pos_hint: {‘center_x’:.5, ‘center_y’:.5} would align a Widget in the middle, no matter what the
size of the window is.

The first thing we need to do to use a RelativeLayout is to import it.
