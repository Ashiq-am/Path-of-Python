This layout allows you to set relative coordinates for children. If you want absolute positioning,
use the FloatLayout. In RelativeLayout each child widget size and position has to be given.

This also does the dynamic placement.







We can do relative positioning by:
pos_hint: provide hint of position
We can define upto 8 keys i.e. it takes arguments in form of dictionary.
pos_hint = {“x”:1, “y”:1, “left”:1, “right”:1, "center_x":1, "center_y":1,
           “top”:1, “bottom”:1("top":0)}
