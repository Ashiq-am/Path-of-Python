The PageLayout works in a different manner from other layouts. It is a dynamic layout, in the sense that it allows flipping through pages
using its borders.

The idea is that its components are stacked in front of each other, and we can just see the one that
is on top.

The PageLayout class is used to create a simple multi-page layout, in a way that allows easy flipping
from one page to another using border.





To use PageLayout you have to import it by the below command:

[from kivy.uix.pagelayout import PageLayout]






Note:
PageLayout does not currently honor the size_hint, size_hint_min, size_hint_max, or pos_hint properties.
That means we can not use all these in a page layout.


















Basic Approach to create PageLayout:
1) import kivy
2) import kivyApp
3) import Pagelayout
4) import button
5) Set minimum version(optional)
6) create App class:
        - define build() function
7) return Layout/widget/Class(according to requirement)
8) Run an instance of the class
