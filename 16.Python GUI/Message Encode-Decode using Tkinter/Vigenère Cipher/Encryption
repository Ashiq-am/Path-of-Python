The first letter of the plaintext, G is paired with A, the first letter of the key.
So use row G and column A of the Vigen√®re square, namely G. Similarly, for the second letter of the
plaintext, the second letter of the key is used, the letter at row E and column Y is C.

The rest of the plaintext is enciphered in a similar fashion.
