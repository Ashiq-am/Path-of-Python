Decryption is performed by going to the row in the table corresponding to the key, finding the position
of the ciphertext letter in this row, and then using the column’s label as the plaintext.

For example, in row A (from AYUSH), the ciphertext G appears in column G, which is the first plaintext
letter. Next we go to row Y (from AYUSH), locate the ciphertext C which is found in column E,
thus E is the second plaintext letter.

A more easy implementation could be to visualize Vigenère algebraically by converting [A-Z] into
numbers [0–25].




Encryption
The plaintext(P) and key(K) are added modulo 26.
Ei = (Pi + Ki) mod 26




Decryption
Di = (Ei - Ki + 26) mod 26



Note: Di denotes the offset of the i-th character of the plaintext. Like offset of A is 0 and of B is 1
and so on.
