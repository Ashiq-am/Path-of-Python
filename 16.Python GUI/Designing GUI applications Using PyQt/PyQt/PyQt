Letâ€™s create a signup form using the QT designer tool. No code is required for creating forms, buttons,
text boxes etc!It is rather a drag and drop environment. So, using PyQt is a lot simpler than Tkinter.

                                            (1)





Open Qt Designer, then select Main Window and click Create. Set your preferred size of the window by
dragging the edges of the window.

                                       (2)



To create the layout of Singup form, following widgets are needed :

1.Three text edit boxes.
2.One button.
3.Four Text Labels (SignId Banner, UserName label, Password and Confirm Password label).


One has to find those widgets in Widget Tool Box. Just drag and drop the required widgets onto the
Main Window or the window working on.

                                          (3)







To change the appearance of window or the widget, just right click on the widget and click Change
StyleSheet.

                                         (4)






To get preview of the window, press Ctrl + R .



Save the file :
The file will be saved with .ui extension. To convert this file (.ui extension) to Python file
(.py extension), follow these steps :

1.Open terminal and navigate to the folder where the layout.ui file is present.
2.To convert into Python file, type pyuic5 -x layout.ui -o layout.py on terminal.
3.Run layout.py using python!
