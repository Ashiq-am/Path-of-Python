When a request is made by the client-server to the webserver, the CGI uses external script files to
handle such requests.
These files could be written in any language. The main objective of these script files is to retrieve
the data from the database quickly and more efficiently.


These scripts convert the retrieved data into an Html format that sends the data to these web servers
in Html formatted page.
