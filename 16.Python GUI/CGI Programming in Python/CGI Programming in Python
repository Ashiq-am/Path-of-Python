What is CGI?

Common Gateway Interface (also known as CGI) is not a kind of language but just a
specification(set of rules) that helps to establish a dynamic interaction between a web application and
the browser (or the client application).

The CGI programs make possible communication between client and web servers.
Whenever the client browser sends a request to the webserver the CGI programs send the output back to
the web server based on the input provided by the client-server.
