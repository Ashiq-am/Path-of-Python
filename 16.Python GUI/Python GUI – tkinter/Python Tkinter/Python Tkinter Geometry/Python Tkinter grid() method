The grid() geometry manager organizes the widgets in the tabular form.
We can specify the rows and columns as the options in the method call.
We can also specify the column span (width) or rowspan(height) of a widget.

This is a more organized way to place the widgets to the python application.
The syntax to use the grid() is given below.



Syntax

widget.grid(options)




A list of possible options that can be passed inside the grid() method is given below.



Column:

rowspan:
The height of the widget, i.e. the number of the row up to which the widget is expanded.



Sticky:
If the cell is larger than a widget, then sticky is used to specify the position of the widget inside
the cell.
It may be the concatenation of the sticky letters representing the position of the widget.
