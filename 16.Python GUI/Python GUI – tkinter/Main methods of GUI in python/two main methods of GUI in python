There are two main methods used which the user needs to remember while creating the Python application
with GUI.



Tk(screenName=None,  baseName=None,  className=’Tk’,  useTk=1):

To create a main window, tkinter offers a method
‘Tk(screenName=None,  baseName=None,  className=’Tk’,  useTk=1)’.
To change the name of the window, you can change the className to the desired one.
The basic code used to create the main window of the application is:


[m=tkinter.Tk() where m is the name of the main window object]





mainloop():

There is a method known by the name mainloop() is used when your application is ready to run.
mainloop() is an infinite loop used to run the application, wait for an event to occur and process
the event as long as the window is not closed.
