Problem â€“ This smart calculator works on the text statement also. The user need not provide algebraic
expression always. It fetches the word form the command (given by the user) and then formulates
the expression.




Examples:

Input  : Hi calculator plz find the lcm of 4 and 8.
Output : 8

Input  : Hi smart plz find the  multiplication of 3 and 9.
Output : 27

Input  : Hi smart plz end the program.
Output : Thanks for enjoy with me.
