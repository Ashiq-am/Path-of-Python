Now lets try to create a program using Tkinter module to create a stopwatch.
A stopwatch is a handheld timepiece designed to measure the amount of time elapsed from a particular
time when it is activated to the time when the piece is deactivated.
A large digital version of a stopwatch designed for viewing at a distance, as in a sports stadium,
is called a stopclock.

In manual timing, the clock is started and stopped by a person pressing a button.
In fully automatic time, both starting and stopping are triggered automatically, by sensors.




Required Modules: We are only going to use tkinter for creating gui and no other libraries will be used
in this program.
