Openpyxl is a Python library using which one can perform multiple operations on excel files like
reading, writing, arithmatic operations and plotting graphs.

Charts are composed of at least one series of one or more data points. Series themselves are comprised of references
to cell ranges. Let’s see how to plot Scatter, Bubble, Pie, 3D Pie Chart on an excel sheet using openpyxl.



For plotting the charts on an excel sheet, firstly, create chart object of specific chart class
( i.e ScatterChart, PieChart etc.).

After creating chart objects, insert data in it and lastly,
add that chart object in the sheet object. Let’s see how to plot different charts using realtime data.
