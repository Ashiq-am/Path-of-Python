Worksheet objects have row_dimensions and column_dimensions attributes that control row heights and column widths.
A sheetâ€™s row_dimensions and column_dimensions are dictionary-like values; row_dimensions contains RowDimension
objects and column_dimensions contains ColumnDimension objects.

In row_dimensions, one can access one of the objects using the number of the row (in this case, 1 or 2).
In column_dimensions, one can access one of the objects using the letter of the column (in this case, A or B).
