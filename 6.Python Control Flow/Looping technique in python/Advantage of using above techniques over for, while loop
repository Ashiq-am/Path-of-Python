1.These techniques are quick to use and reduces coding effort.
for, while loops needs the entire structure of container to be changed.


2.These Looping techniques  do not require any structural changes to container.
They have keywords which present the exact purpose of usage. Whereas,
no pre-predictions or guesses can be made in for, while loop i.e not easily understandable the purpose at a glance.


3.Looping technique make the code more concise than using for, while loopings.
