1.Using enumerate():

enumerate() is used to loop through the containers printing the index number along with the value
present in that particular index.




2.Using zip():

zip() is used to combine 2 similar containers(list-list or dict-dict) printing the values sequentially. The loop exists
only till the smaller container ends. The detailed explanation of zip() and enumerate() can be found here.




3.Using iteritem(): iteritems() is used to loop through the dictionary printing the dictionary key-value pair
sequentially.




4.Using items():  items() performs the similar task on dictionary as iteritems() but have certain disadvantages
when compared with iteritems().

**It is very time consuming. Calling it on large dictionaries consumes quite a lot of time.
**It takes a lot of memory. Sometimes takes double the memory when called on dictionary.




5.Using sorted():  sorted() is used to print the container is sorted order.
It doesnâ€™t sort the container, but just prints the container in sorted order for 1 instance.
Use of set() can be combined to remove duplicate occurrences.





6.Using reversed(): reversed() is used to print the values of container in the reversed order.
Note: It does not reflect any changes to the original list
