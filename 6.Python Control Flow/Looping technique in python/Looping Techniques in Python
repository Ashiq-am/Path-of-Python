Python supports various looping techniques by certain inbuilt functions, in various sequential containers.
These methods are primarily verya useful in competitive programming and also in various project which require a
specific technique with loops maintaining the overall structure of code.





Where they are used ?

Different looping techniques are primarily useful in the places where we donâ€™t need to actually manipulate
the structure and ordering of overall container, rather only print the elements for a single use instance,
no inplace change occurs in the container. This can also be used in instances to save time.
