Python programming language allows to use one loop inside another loop.
Following section shows few examples to illustrate the concept.



Syntax:


for iterator_var in sequence:
    for iterator_var in sequence:
        statements(s)
        statements(s)





The syntax for a nested while loop statement in Python programming language is as follows:

while expression:
    while expression:
        statement(s)
        statement(s)




A final note on loop nesting is that we can put any type of loop inside of any other type of loop.
For example a for loop can be inside a while loop or vice versa.
