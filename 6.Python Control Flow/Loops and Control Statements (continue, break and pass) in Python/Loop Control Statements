Loop control statements change execution from its normal sequence.
When execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed.
Python supports the following control statements.






Continue Statement
It returns the control to the beginning of the loop.





Break Statement
It brings control out of the loop






Pass Statement
We use pass statement to write empty loops. Pass is also used for empty control statement, function and classes.
