For loops are used for sequential traversal.

For example: traversing a list or string or array etc. In Python,
there is no C style for loop, i.e., for (i=0; i<n; i++). There is “for in” loop which is similar to for each
loop in other languages. Let us learn how to use for in loop for sequential traversals.


Syntax:

for iterator_var in sequence:
    statements(s)




It can be used to iterate over iterators and a range.
