Python programming language provides following types of loops to handle looping requirements.
Python provides three ways for executing the loops. While all the ways provide similar basic functionality,
they differ in their syntax and condition checking time.


While Loop:
In python, while loop is used to execute a block of statements repeatedly until a given a condition is satisfied.
And when the condition becomes false, the line immediately after the loop in program is executed.

Syntax :


while expression:
    statement(s)


All the statements indented by the same number of character spaces after a programming construct are considered
to be part of a single block of code. Python uses indentation as its method of grouping statements.





*Using else statement with while loops:

As discussed above,while loop executes the block until a condition is satisfied.
When the condition becomes false, the statement
immediately after the loop is executed.

The else clause is only executed when your while condition becomes false. If you break out of the loop,
or if an exception is raised, it wonâ€™t be executed.
If else like this:


if condition:
	# execute these statements
else:
	# execute these statements


and while loop like this are similar



while condition:
	# execute these statements
else:
	# execute these statements





*Single statement while block:

Just like the if block, if the while block consists of a single statement the we can declare the entire loop
in a single line as shown below:


Note: It is suggested not to use this type of loops as it is a never ending infinite loop where the condition is always
true and you have to forcefully terminate the compiler.
