 Loop control statements change execution from its normal sequence. When execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects

 that were created in that scope are destroyed. Python supports the following control statements.




1.Continue Statement:

It returns the control to the beginning of the loop




2.Break Statement:

It brings control out of the loop




3.Pass Statement:

We use pass statement to write empty loops. Pass is also used for empty control statement, function and classes.
