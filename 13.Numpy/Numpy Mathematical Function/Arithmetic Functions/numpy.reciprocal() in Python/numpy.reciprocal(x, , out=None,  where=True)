This mathematical function is used to calculate reciprocal of all the elements in the input array.




Parameters :

x[array_like]: Input array or object whose elements needed to test.




out [ndarray, optional]: A location into which the result is stored.
  –> If provided, it must have a shape that the inputs broadcast to.
  –> If not provided or None, a freshly-allocated array is returned.





**kwargs : Allows to pass keyword variable length of argument to a function. Used when we want to
           handle named argument in a function.



where [array_like, optional]: True value means to calculate the universal functions(ufunc) at that
                              position, False value means to leave the value in the output alone.




Return :
y : ndarray. This is a scalar if x is a scalar.





Note: For integer arguments with absolute value larger than 1, the result is always zero because
      of the way Python handles integer division. For integer zero the result is an overflow.
