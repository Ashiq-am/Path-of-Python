We have initialised the database pythonDB.py. This instruction will create the database if the database doesnâ€™t exist.

If the database having the same name as defined exist than it will move further.
In the second statement, we use a method of sqlite3 named cursor(), this help you to initiate the database as active.



Cursors are created by the connection cursor() method, they are bound to the connection for the entire lifetime
and all the commands are executed in the context of the database session wrapped by the connection.
