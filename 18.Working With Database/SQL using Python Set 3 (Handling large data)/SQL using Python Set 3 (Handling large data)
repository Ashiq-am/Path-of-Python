In the previous articles the records of the database were limited to small size and single tuple.
This article will explain how to write & fetch large data from the database using module SQLite3 covering
all exceptions.

A simple way is to execute the query and use fetchall(). This has been already discussed in SET 1.




1.executescript()
This is a convenience method for executing multiple SQL statements at once. It executes the SQL script it gets as
a parameter.




Syntax:

sqlite3.connect.executescript(script)







2.executemany()
It is often the case when, large amount of data has to be inserted into database from Data Files
(for simpler case take Lists, arrays).
It would be simple to iterate the code many a times than write every time, each line into database.
But the use of loop would not be suitable in this case, the below example shows why.
Syntax and use of executemany() is explained below and how it can be used like a loop.
