Once we have created the database in PostgreSQL, we can access that database in python. We first create an emp
table in the database called test with the schema: (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(10), salary INT, dept INT).
Once the table is created without any errors, we insert values into the table.


Once the values are inserted, we can query the table to select all the rows and display them to the user using the
fetchall() function.
