before we can access the database in python, we need to create the database in postgresql. To create the database,
follow the steps given below:



1.Log in to PostgreSQL:
      sudo -u postgres psql




2.Configure the password:
      \password
      (You will then be prompted to enter the password. remember this as we will use it to connect to the
      database in Python)




3.Create a database called “test”. we will connect to this database.
            CREATE DATABASE test;

Once the database and password have been configured, exit the psql server.
