PostgreSQL is an open source object-relational database management system. It is well known for its reliability,
robustness, and performance.

PostgreSQL has a variety of libraries of API (Application programmable interface) that are available for a variety
of popular programming languages such as Python.

It provides a lot of features for Database management such as Views, Triggers, Indexes (using B-Trees), etc.





There are several python modules that allow us to connect to and manipulate the database using PostgreSQL:

1.Psycopg2
2.pg8000
3.py-postgresql
4.PyGreSQL









Psycopg2 is one of the most popular python drivers for PostgreSQL. It is actively maintained and provides support
for different versions of python.
It also provides support for Threads and can be used in multithreaded applications. For these reasons,
it is a popular choice for developers.



In this article, we shall explore the features of PostgreSQl using psycopg2 by building a simple database
management system in python.

{Installation:

sudo pip3 install psycopg2}


Note: if you are using Python2, use pip install instead of pip3

Once psycopg has been installed in your system, we can connect to the database and execute queries in Python.
