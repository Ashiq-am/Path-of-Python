The connect() method is used to establish connection with the database. It takes 5 parameters:

1.database: The name of the database you are connecting to
2.user: the username of your local system
3.password: the password to log in to psql
4.host: The host, which is set to localhost by default
6.port: The port number which is 5432 by default



conn = psycopg2.connect(
            database="test",
            user = "adith",
            password = "password",
            host = "localhost",
            port = "5432")





Once the connection has been established, we can manipulate the database in python.

The Cursor object is used to execute sql queries. we can create a cursor object using the connecting object (conn)

 {cur = conn.cursor()}

Using this object, we can make changes to the database that we are connected to.






After you have executed all the queries, we need to disconnect from the connection. Not disconnecting will not
cause any errors but it is generally considered a good practice to disconnect.

 {conn.close()}
