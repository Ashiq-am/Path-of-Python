In this article, database connection with the python program is discussed. Connecting a program with a database
is considered a tough task in any programming language.
It is used to connect the front-end of your application with the back-end database.
Python with its native builtin modules made this thing easy too.

This needs the basic understanding of SQL.Here, we are going to connect SQLite with Python.
Python has a native library for SQLite. Let us explain how it works.





1.To use SQLite, we must import sqlite3.





2.Then create a connection using connect() method and pass the name of the database you want to access if there is
  a file with that name, it will open that file. Otherwise, Python will create a file with the given name.




3.After this, a cursor object is called to be capable to send commands to the SQL. Cursor is a control structure
    used to traverse and fetch the records of the database.
    Cursor has a major role in working with Python. All the commands will be executed using cursor object only.






4.To create a table in the database, create an object and write the SQL command in it with being commented.
   Example:- sql_comm = ”SQL statement”







5.And executing the command is very easy. Call the cursor method execute and pass the name of the sql command as
   a parameter in it. Save a number of commands as the sql_comm and execute them.
   After you perform all your activities, save the changes in the file by committing those changes and then lose
   the connection.
