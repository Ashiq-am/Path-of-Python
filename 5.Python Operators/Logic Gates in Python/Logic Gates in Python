A Logic gate is an elementary building block of any digital circuits.
It takes one or two inputs and produces output based on those inputs. Outputs may be high (1) or low (0).

Logic gates are implemented using diodes or transistors. It can also be constructed using vacuum tubes,
electromagnetic elements like optics, molecule etc.
In a computer, most of the electronic circuits are made up logic gates.
Logic gates are used to create a circuit that performs calculations, data storage or
shows off object-oriented programming especially the power of inheritance.

There are seven basic logic gates defined, these are: AND gate, OR gate, NOT gate, NAND gate, NOR gate ,
XOR gate and XNOR gate.






1. AND Gate
The AND gate gives an output of 1 if both the two inputs are 1, it gives 0 otherwise.





2. NAND Gate
The NAND gate (negated AND) gives an output of 0 if both inputs are 1, it gives 1 otherwise.





3. OR Gate
The OR gate gives an output of 1 if either of the two inputs are 1, it gives 0 otherwise.





4. XOR Gate
The XOR gate gives an output of 1 if either both inputs are different, it gives 0 if they are same.





5. NOT Gate
It acts as an inverter. It takes only one input. If the input is given as 1,
it will invert the result as 0 and vice-versa.






6. NOR Gate
The NOR gate (negated OR) gives an output of 1 if both inputs are 0, it gives 1 otherwise.




7. XNOR Gate
The XNOR gate (negated XOR) gives an output of 1 both inputs are same and 0 if both are different.
