                                        Membership Operators

Membership operators are operators used to validate the membership of a value.
It test for membership in a sequence, such as strings, lists, or tuples.

in operator :

The ‘in’ operator is used to check if a value exists in a sequence or not.
Evaluates to true if it finds a variable in the specified sequence and false otherwise.




'not in’ operator-
Evaluates to true if it does not finds a variable in the specified sequence and false otherwise







                                         Identity operators

In Python are used to determine whether a value is of a certain class or type.
They are usually used to determine the type of data a certain variable contains.
There are different identity operators such as


‘is’ operator –
Evaluates to true if the variables on either side of the operator point to the same
object and false otherwise.


‘is not’ operator –
Evaluates to false if the variables on either side of the operator point to the same object and true
otherwise.
