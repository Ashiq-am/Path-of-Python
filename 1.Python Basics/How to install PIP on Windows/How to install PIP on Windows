Before we start with how to install pip for Python on Windows, let’s first go through the basic introduction to
Python.

Python is a widely-used general-purpose, high-level programming language.
Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more efficiently.



PIP is a package management system used to install and manage software packages/libraries written in Python.
These files are stored in a large “on-line repository” termed as Python Package Index (PyPI).


pip uses PyPI as the default source for packages and their dependencies. So whenever you type:




""pip install package_name""



pip will look for that package on PyPI and if found, it will download and install the package on your local system.
