A nested if is an if statement that is the target of another if statement.
Nested if statements means an if statement inside another if statement.

Yes, Python allows us to nest if statements within if statements. i.e, we can place an if statement inside
another if statement.

   # Executes when condition1 is true
   if (condition2):
      # Executes when condition2 is true
   # if Block is end here
# if Block is end here
