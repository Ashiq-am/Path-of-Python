if statement is the most simple decision making statement. It is used to decide whether a certain statement or
block of statements will be executed or not i.e if a certain condition is true then a block of statement is
executed otherwise not.




Syntax:

if condition:
   # Statements to execute if
   # condition is true




Here, condition after evaluation will be either true or false. if statement accepts boolean values – if the value
is true then it will execute the block of statements below it otherwise not.
We can use condition with bracket ‘(‘ ‘)’ also.

As we know, python uses indentation to identify a block. So the block under an if statement will be identified
as shown in the below example:





if condition:
   statement1
statement2

# Here if the condition is true, if block
# will consider only statement1 to be inside
# its block.
