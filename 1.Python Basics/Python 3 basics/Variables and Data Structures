In other programming languages like C, C++ and Java, you will need to declare the type of variables but in Python
you donâ€™t need to do that.

Just type in the variable and when values will be given to it, then it will automatically know whether the value given
would be a int, float or char or even a String.







List is the most basic Data Structure in python. List is mutable data structure i.e items can be added to
list later after the list creation.

Its like you are going to shop at local market and made a list of some items and later on you can add more and
more items to the list.

append() function is used to add data to the list.
