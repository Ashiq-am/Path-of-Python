Some statements may become very long and may force you to scroll the screen left and right frequently.
You can fit your code in such a way that you do not have to scroll here and there.

Python allows you to write a single statement in multiple lines, also known as line continuation.
Line continuation enhances readability as well.








# Bad Practice as width of this code is too much.

#code
x = 10
y = 20
z = 30
no_of_teachers = x
no_of_male_students = y
no_of_female_students = z

if (no_of_teachers == 10 and no_of_female_students == 30 and no_of_male_students == 20 and (x + y) == 30):
    print('The course is valid')

# This could be done instead:

if (no_of_teachers == 10 and no_of_female_students == 30
    and no_of_male_students == 20 and x + y == 30):
    print('The course is valid')
