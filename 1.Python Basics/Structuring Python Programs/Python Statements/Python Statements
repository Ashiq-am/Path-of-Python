In general, the interpreter reads and executes the statements line by line i.e sequentially.
Though, there are some statements that can alter this behavior like conditional statements.

Mostly, python statements are written in such a format that one statement is only written in a single line.
The interpreter considers the ‘new line character’ as the terminator of one instruction.
But, writing multiple statements per line is also possible that you can find below.
