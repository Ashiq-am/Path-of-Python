The most common whitespace characters are the following:





CHARACTER	                                  ASCII CODE	                                        LITERAL EXPRESSION

Space	                                      32 (0x20)	                                                    ‘ ‘

tab	                                           9 (0x9)	                                                    ‘\t’

newline	                                       10 (0xA)	                                                    ‘\n’

Whitespace is mostly ignored, and mostly not required, by the Python interpreter.
When it is clear where one token ends and the next one starts, whitespace can be omitted.
This is usually the case when special non-alphanumeric characters are involved.
