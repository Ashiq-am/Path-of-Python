In general, there are two types of line continuation





1.Implicit Line Continuation:-


This is the most straightforward technique in writing a statement that spans multiple lines.
Any statement containing opening parentheses (‘(‘), brackets (‘[‘), or curly braces (‘{‘) is presumed to
be incomplete until all matching parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces have been encountered.
Until then, the statement can be implicitly continued across lines without raising an error.








2.Explicit Line Continuation:-

Explicit Line joining is used mostly when implicit line joining is not applicable.
In this method, you have to use a character that helps the interpreter to understand that the particular
statement is spanning more than one lines.

Backslash (\) is used to indicate that a statement spans more than one line.
The point is to be noted that ” must be the last character in that line, even white-space is not allowed.
