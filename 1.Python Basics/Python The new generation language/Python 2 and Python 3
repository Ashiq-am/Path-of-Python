Currently, there are two versions of Python available Python 2 and Python 3. Many beginners must be wondering with
which version of Python they should start.

My answer to this question is usually something along the lines “just go with the version your favourite tutorial
is written in, and check out the differences later on.”





Softwares making use of Python:-

Python has been successfully embedded in a number of software products as a scripting language.

1.GNU Debugger uses Python as a pretty printer to show complex structures such as C++ containers.
2.Python has also been used in artificial intelligence
3.Python is often used for natural language processing tasks.






Current Applications of Python:-

1.A number of Linux distributions use installers written in Python example in Ubuntu we have the Ubiquity
2.Python has seen extensive use in the information security industry, including in exploit development.
3.Raspberry Pi– single board computer uses Python as its principal user-programming language.
4.Python is now being used Game Development areas also.













Pros:

1.Ease of use
2.Multi-paradigm Approach



Cons:


1.Slow speed of execution compared to C,C++

2.Absence from mobile computing and browsers

3.For the C,C++ programmers switching to python can be irritating as the language requires proper indentation of code.
Certain variable names commonly used like sum are functions in python.
So C, C++ programmers have to look out for these.







Industrial Importance

Most of the companies are now looking for candidates who know about Python Programming.
Those having the knowledge of python may have more chances of impressing the interviewing panel.
So I would suggest that beginners should start learning python and excel in it.
