The classical Hello World program illustrating the relative verbosity of a Java Program and Python Program



Java Code




public class HelloWorld
{
public static void main (String[] args)
{
	System.out.println("Hello, world!");
}
}




Python Code:-



print "Hello, world!"



print("Hello, world!") # Python version 3





Similarity with Java

**Require some form of runtime on your system (JVM/Python runtime)

**Can probably be compiled to executables without the runtime (this is situational, none of them are designed
to work this way)
