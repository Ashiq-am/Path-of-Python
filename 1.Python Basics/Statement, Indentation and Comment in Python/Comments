Python developers often make use of the comment system as, without the use of it, things can get real confusing,
real fast. Comments are the useful information that the developers provide to make the reader understand the
source code. It explains the logic or a part of it used in the code.

Comments are usually helpful to someone maintaining or enhancing your code when you are no longer around to answer
questions about it.
These are often cited as a useful programming convention that does not take part in the output of the program
but improves the readability of the whole program. There are two types of comment in Python:






1.Single line comments :

Python single line comment starts with hashtag symbol with no white spaces (#) and lasts till the end of the line.
If the comment exceeds one line then put a hashtag on the next line and continue the comment.
Pythonâ€™s single line comments are proved useful for supplying short explanations for variables,
function declarations, and expressions.





2.Multi-line string as comment :

Python multi-line comment is a piece of text enclosed in a delimiter (""") on each end of the comment.
Again there should be no white space between delimiter (""").
They are useful when the comment text does not fit into one line; therefore needs to span across lines.
Multi-line comments or paragraphs serve as documentation for others reading your code.
