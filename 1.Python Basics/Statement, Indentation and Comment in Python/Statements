Instructions written in the source code for execution are called statements. There are different types of statements in the Python programming language like Assignment statement, Conditional statement, Looping statements etc. These all help the user to get the required output. For example, n = 50 is an assignment statement.






Multi-Line Statements:-

Statements in Python can be extended to one or more lines using parentheses (), braces {}, square brackets [],
semi-colon (;), continuation character slash (\).

When the programmer needs to do long calculations and cannot fit his statements into one line,
one can make use of these characters.





Example :

Declared using Continuation Character (\):
s = 1 + 2 + 3 + \
    4 + 5 + 6 + \
    7 + 8 + 9

Declared using parentheses () :
n = (1 * 2 * 3 + 7 + 8 + 9)

Declared using square brackets [] :
footballer = ['MESSI',
          'NEYMAR',
          'SUAREZ']

Declared using braces {} :
x = {1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 +
     7 + 8 + 9}

Declared using semicolons(;) :
flag = 2; ropes = 3; pole = 4
