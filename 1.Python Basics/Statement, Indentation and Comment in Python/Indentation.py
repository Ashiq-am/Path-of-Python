'''To indicate a block of code in Python, you must indent each line of the block by the same whitespace. 
The two lines of code in the while loop are both indented four spaces. 
It is required for indicating what block of code a statement belongs to. 
For example, j=1 and while(j<=5): is not indented, and so it is not within while block. 
So, Python code structures by indentation.'''
