A block is a combination of all these statements. Block can be regarded as the grouping of statements for a
specific purpose.

Most of the programming languages like C, C++, Java use braces { } to define a block of code.
One of the distinctive features of Python is its use of indentation to highlight the blocks of code.

Whitespace is used for indentation in Python.

All statements with the same distance to the right belong to the same block of code.

If a block has to be more deeply nested, it is simply indented further to the right.
