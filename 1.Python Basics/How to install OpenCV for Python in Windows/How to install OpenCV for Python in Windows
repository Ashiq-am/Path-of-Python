OpenCV is the huge open-source library for computer vision, machine learning, and image processing and now it
plays a major role in real-time operation which is very important in todayâ€™s systems.

By using it, one can process images and videos to identify objects, faces, or even the handwriting of a human.
When it integrated with various libraries, such as Numpuy, python is capable of processing the OpenCV array
structure for analysis.

To Identify image patterns and its various features we use vector space and perform mathematical operations on
these features.


To install OpenCV, one must have Python and PIP, preinstalled on their system. To check if your system already
contains Python, go through the following instructions:


Open the Command line(search for cmd in the Run dialog( + R).
Now run the following command:




"python --version"



If Python is already installed, it will generate a message with the Python version available.
