A namespace is a system to have a unique name for each and every object in Python.
An object might be a variable or a method.
Python itself maintains a namespace in the form of a Python dictionary.
Let’s go through an example, a directory-file system structure in computers.
Needless to say, that one can have multiple directories having a file with the same name inside of every directory.
But one can get directed to the file, one wishes, just by specifying the absolute path to the file.


Real-time example, the role of a namespace is like a surname. One might not find a single “Alice” in the class there
might be multiple “Alice” but when you particularly ask for “Alice Lee” or “Alice Clark” (with a surname),
there will be only one (time being don’t think of both first name and surname are same for multiple students).



On the similar lines, Python interpreter understands what exact method or variable one is trying to point
to in the code, depending upon the namespace.
So, the division of the word itself gives little more information.

Its Name (which means name, an unique identifier) + Space(which talks something related to scope).
Here, a name might be of any Python method or variable and space depends upon the location from where is
trying to access a variable or a method.
