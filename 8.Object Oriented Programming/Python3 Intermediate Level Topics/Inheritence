Inheritance is defined as a way in which a particular class inherits features from its base class.
Base class is also knows as ‘Superclass’ and the class which inherits from the Superclass is knows as ‘Subclass’




                      Base Class                              Derived Class


                      Feature 1                                Feature 1
                      Feature 2                                Feature 2
                      Feature 3                                Feature 3
                                                             ______________
                                                               Feature 4

As shown in the figure the Derived class can inherit features from its base class, also it can define its own features too.
