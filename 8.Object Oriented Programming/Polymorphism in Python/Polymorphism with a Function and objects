It is also possible to create a function that can take any object, allowing for polymorphism.
In this example, let’s create a function called “func()” which will take an object which we will name “obj”.
Though we are using the name ‘obj’, any instantiated object will be able to be called into this function.
Next, lets give the function something to do that uses the ‘obj’ object we passed to it.

In this case lets call the three methods, viz., capital(),
language() and type(), each of which is defined in the two classes ‘India’ and ‘USA’. Next,
let’s create instantiations of both the ‘India’ and ‘USA’ classes if we don’t have them already.

With those, we can call their action using the same func() function:
