To create our custom metaclass, our custom metaclass have to inherit type metaclass and usually override –

__new__(): It’s a method which is called before __init__(). It creates the object and return it. We can
overide this method to control how the objects are created.

__init__(): This method just initialize the created object passed as parameter.

We can create classes using type() function directly. It can be called in following ways –

1.When called with only one argument, it returns the type. We have seen it before in above examples.
2.When called with three parameters, it creates a class. Following arguments are passed to it –

 1.Class name
 2.Tuple having base classes inherited by class
 3.Class Dictionary: It serves as local namespace for the class, populated with class methods and variables
