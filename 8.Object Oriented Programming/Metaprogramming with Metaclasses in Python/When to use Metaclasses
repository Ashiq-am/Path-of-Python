Most of the time we are not using metaclasses, they are like black magic and usually for something complicated,
but few cases where we use metaclasses are â€“

1.As we have seen in above example, metaclasses propogate down the inheritance hierarchies. It will affect all the subclasses as well. If we have such situation, then we should use metaclasses.
2.If we want to change class automatically, when it is created.
3.If you are API developer, you might use metaclasses.
