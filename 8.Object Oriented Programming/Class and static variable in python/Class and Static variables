Class or static variables are shared by all objects. Instance or non-static variables are different for different objects (every object has a copy of it).
For example, let a Computer Science Student be represented by class CSStudent.
The class may have a static variable whose value is “cse” for all objects.
And class may also have non-static members like name and roll.

In C++ and Java, we can use static keyword to make a variable as class variable.
The variables which don’t have preceding static keyword are instance variables. See this for Java example and this for C++ example.





The Python approach is simple, it doesn’t require a static keyword.
All variables which are assigned a value in class declaration are class variables.
And variables which are assigned values inside class methods are instance variables.
