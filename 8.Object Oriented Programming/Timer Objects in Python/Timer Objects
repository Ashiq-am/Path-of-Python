Timer objects are used to represent actions that needs to be scheduled to run after a certain instant of time.
These objects get scheduled to run on a separate thread that carries out the action. However,
the interval that a timer is initialized with might not be the actual instant when the action,
was actually performed by the interpreter because it is the responsibility of the thread scheduler,
to actually schedule the thread corresponding to the timer object.Timer is a sub class of Thread class defined in python.
It is started by calling the start() function corresponding to the timer explicitly.



Syntax:

threading.Timer(interval, function, args = None, kwargs = None)
