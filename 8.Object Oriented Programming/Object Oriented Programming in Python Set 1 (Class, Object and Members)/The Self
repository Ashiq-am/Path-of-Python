The self

Class methods must have an extra first parameter in method definition.
We do not give a value for this parameter when we call the method, Python provides it
If we have a method which takes no arguments, then we still have to have one argument – the self. See fun() in above simple example.



This is similar to this pointer in C++ and this reference in Java.
When we call a method of this object as myobject.method(arg1, arg2),
this is automatically converted by Python into MyClass.method(myobject, arg1, arg2) – this is all the special self is about.
