str() and repr() both are used to get a string representation of object.


Following are differences:

str() is used for creating output for end user while repr() is mainly used for debugging and
development.


repr’s goal is to be unambiguous and str’s is to be readable.
For example, if we suspect a float has a small rounding error, repr will show us while str
may not.

repr() compute the “official” string representation of an object (a representation that has
all information about the abject) and str() is used to compute the “informal” string
representation of an object (a representation that is useful for printing the object).


The print statement and str() built-in function uses __str__ to display the string
representation of the object while the repr() built-in function uses __repr__ to display
the object.
