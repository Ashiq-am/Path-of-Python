nheritance enable us to define a class that takes all the functionality from parent class and allows us to add more.

Inheritance is a powerful feature in object oriented programming.

It refers to defining a new class with little or no modification to an existing class.
The new class is called derived (or child) class and the one from which it inherits is called the base (or parent) class.


Python Inheritance Syntax


class BaseClass:
  Body of base class
class DerivedClass(BaseClass):
  Body of derived class


Derived class inherits features from the base class, adding new features to it. This results into re-usability of code.
