Like C++, a class can be derived from more than one base classes in Python. This is called multiple inheritance.

In multiple inheritance, the features of all the base classes are inherited into the derived class.
The syntax for multiple inheritance is similar to single inheritance.


Example


class Base1:
    pass
class Base2:
    pass
class MultiDerived(Base1, Base2):
    pass


Here, MultiDerived is derived from classes Base1 and Base2.The class MultiDerived inherits from both Base1 and Base2.
