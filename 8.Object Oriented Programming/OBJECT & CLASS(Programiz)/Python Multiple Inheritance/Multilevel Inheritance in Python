On the other hand, we can also inherit form a derived class. This is called multilevel inheritance.
It can be of any depth in Python.

In multilevel inheritance, features of the base class and the derived class is inherited into the new derived class.

An example with corresponding visualization is given below.



class Base:
    pass
class Derived1(Base):
    pass
class Derived2(Derived1):
    pass



Here, Derived1 is derived from Base, and Derived2 is derived from Derived1.
