Polymorphism is an ability (in OOP) to use common interface for multiple form (data types).

Suppose, we need to color a shape, there are multiple shape option (rectangle, square, circle).
However we could use same method to color any shape. This concept is called Polymorphism.




In the above program, we defined two classes Parrot and Penguin. Each of them have common method fly() method.
However, their functions are different. To allow polymorphism,
we created common interface i.e flying_test() function that can take any object.
Then, we passed the objects blu and peggy in the flying_test() function, it ran effectively.
