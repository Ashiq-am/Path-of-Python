Like function definitions begin with the keyword def, in Python, we define a class using the keyword class.

The first string is called docstring and has a brief description about the class. Although not mandatory, this is recommended.

Here is a simple class definition.



class MyNewClass:
    '''This is a docstring. I have created a new class'''
    pass


A class creates a new local namespace where all its attributes are defined. Attributes may be data or functions.

There are also special attributes in it that begins with double underscores (__).
For example, __doc__ gives us the docstring of that class.

As soon as we define a class, a new class object is created with the same name.
This class object allows us to access the different attributes as well as to instantiate new objects of that class.
