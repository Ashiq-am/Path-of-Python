Class functions that begins with double underscore (__) are called special functions as they have special meaning.

Of one particular interest is the __init__() function.
This special function gets called whenever a new object of that class is instantiated.

This type of function is also called constructors in Object Oriented Programming (OOP).
We normally use it to initialize all the variables.

In the above example, we define a new class to represent complex numbers.
It has two functions, __init__() to initialize the variables (defaults to zero) and getData() to display the number properly.

An interesting thing to note in the above step is that attributes of an object can be created on the fly.
We created a new attribute attr for object c2 and we read it as well. But this did not create that attribute for object c1.
