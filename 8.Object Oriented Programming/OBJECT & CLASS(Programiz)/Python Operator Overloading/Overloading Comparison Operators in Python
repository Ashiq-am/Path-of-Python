Python does not limit operator overloading to arithmetic operators only. We can overload comparison operators as well.

Suppose, we wanted to implement the less than symbol < symbol in our Point class.

Let us compare the magnitude of these points from the origin and return the result for this purpose.
It can be implemented as follows.

Try these sample runs in Python shell.


>>> Point(1,1) < Point(-2,-3)
True
>>> Point(1,1) < Point(0.5,-0.2)
False
>>> Point(1,1) < Point(1,1)
False



Similarly, the special functions that we need to implement, to overload other comparison operators are tabulated below.




Operator	                                  Expression	                             Internally
Less than	                                    p1 < p2	                                p1.__lt__(p2)
Less than or equal to	                        p1 <= p2	                            p1.__le__(p2)
Equal to                                        p1 == p2	                            p1.__eq__(p2)
Not equal to	                                p1 != p2	                            p1.__ne__(p2)
Greater than	                                p1 > p2	                                p1.__gt__(p2)
Greater than or equal to	                    p1 >= p2	                            p1.__ge__(p2)
