Invoking the garbage collector manually during the execution of a program can be a good idea,
on how to handle memory being consumed by reference cycles.



There are two ways for performing manual garbage collection: time-based and event-based garbage collection.

Time-based :garbage collection is simple: the garbage collector is called after a fixed time interval.

Event-based :garbage collection calls the garbage collector on event occurrence.
For example, when a user exits the application or when the application enters into idle state.
