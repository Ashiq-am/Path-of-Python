Like Java Object class, in Python (from version 3.x), object is root of all classes.

In Python 3.x, “class Test(object)” and “class Test” are same.
In Python 2.x, “class Test(object)” creates a class with object as parent (called new style class) and “class Test” creates old style class (without object parent).
Refer this for more details.
