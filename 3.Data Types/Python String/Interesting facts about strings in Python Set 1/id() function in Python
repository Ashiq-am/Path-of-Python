Introduction
id() is an inbuilt function in Python.



Syntax:

id(object)




As we can see the function accepts a single parameter and is used to return the identity of an object.
This identity has to be unique and constant for this object during the lifetime.
Two objects with non-overlapping lifetimes may have the same id() value.
If we relate this to C, then they are actually the memory address,here in Python it is the unique id.
This function is generally used internally in Python.








Examples:




The output is the identity of the
object passed. This is random but
when running in the same program,
it generates unique and same identity.

Input : id(1025)
Output : 140365829447504
Output varies with different runs

Input : id("geek")
Output : 139793848214784
