Multiple pairs of curly braces can be used while formatting the string. Let’s say if another variable
substitution is needed in sentence, can be done by adding a second pair of curly braces and passing
a second value into the method. Python will replace the placeholders by values in order.





Syntax : { } { } .format(value1, value2)






Parameters :

(value1, value2) : Can be integers, floating point numeric constants, strings, characters and even variables.
Only difference is, the number of values passed as parameters in format() method must be equal to the number
of placeholders created in the string.






Errors and Exceptions :

IndexError : Occurs when string has an extra placeholder and we didn’t pass any value for it in the format()
method. Python usually assigns the placeholders with default index in order like 0, 1, 2, 3….
to acces the values passed as parameters. So when it encounters a placeholder whose index doesn’t have
any value passed inside as parameter, it throws IndexError.
