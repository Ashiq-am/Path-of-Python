When placeholders { } are empty, Python will replace the values passed through str.format() in order.

The values that exist within the str.format() method are essentially tuple data types and each individual
value contained in the tuple can be called by its index number, which starts with the index number 0.

These index numbers can be passes into the curly braces that serve as the placeholders in the original string.





Syntax : {0} {1}.format(positional_argument, keyword_argument)





Parameters : (positional_argument, keyword_argument)

***Positional_argument can be integers, floating point numeric constants, strings, characters and even
     variables.

***Keyword_argument is essentially a variable storing some value, which is passed as parameter.
