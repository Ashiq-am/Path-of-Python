Like other programming languages, itâ€™s possible to access individual characters of a string by using array-

like indexing syntax.


In this we can access each and every element of string through their index number and the indexing starts from 0.
Python does index out of bound checking.




So, we can obtain the required character using syntax, string_name[index_position]:




***The positive index_position denotes the element from the starting(0) and the negative index shows the index
from the end(-1).












                                                        Slicing

To extract substring from the whole string then we use the syntax like

string_name[beginning: end : step]



****beginning represents the starting index of string
****end denotes the end index of string which is not inclusive
****steps denotes the distance between the two words.



Note: We can also slice the string using beginning and only and steps are optional.
