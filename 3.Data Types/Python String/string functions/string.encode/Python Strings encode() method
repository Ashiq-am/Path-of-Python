encode() is a method specified in Strings in Python 2.

In today’s world, security holds the key in many of the applications. Thus the need for
secure storage of passwords in database is required and hence there is to save encoded
versions of strings. To achieve this, python in its language has defined “encode()”
that encodes strings with the specified encoded scheme.
There are several encoded schemes defined in the language.





The strings can be using the function encode() that returns the encoded version of
string according to the specified encoding.

Syntax : encode(encoding, error)



Parameters :

encoding : Specifies the encoding on the basis of which encoding has to be performed.
error : Decides how to handle the errors if they occur, e.g ‘strict’ raises Unicode error
        in case of exception and ‘ignore’ ignores the errors occurred.






Returns : Returns the string in the encoded form
