While printing Strings with single and double quotes in it causes SyntaxError because
String already contains Single and Double Quotes and hence cannot be printed with the
use of either of these.

Hence, to print such a String either Triple Quotes are used or Escape sequences are
used to print such Strings.



Escape sequences start with a backslash and can be interpreted differently.
If single quotes are used to represent a string, then all the single quotes present
in the string must be escaped and same is done for Double Quotes.
