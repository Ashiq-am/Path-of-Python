In python, dictionary is similar to hash or maps in other languages. It consists of key value pairs.
The value can be accessed by unique key in the dictionary.










                                                   break, continue, pass in Python


break – takes you out of the current loop.



continue – ends the current iteration in the loop and moves to the next iteration.



pass – The pass statement does nothing. It can be used when a statement is required.
       syntactically but the program requires no action. It is commonly used for creating minimal classes.










                                                map, filter, lambda

map – The map() function applies a function to every member of iterable and returns the result.
      If there are multiple arguments, map() returns a list consisting of tuples containing the corresponding
      items from all iterables.





filter – It takes a function returning True or False and applies it to a sequence,
         returning a list of only those members of the sequence for which the function returned True.




lambda- Python provides the ability to create a simple (no statements allowed internally) anonymous inline
        function called lambda function. Using lambda and map you can have two for loops in one line.
