In Python List, there are multiple ways to print the whole List with all the
elements,
but to print a specific range of elements from the list, we use Slice operation.
Slice operation is performed on Lists with the use of colon(:).

To print elements from beginning to a range use [:Index],
to print elements from end use [:-Index], to print elements from specific
Index till the end use [Index:],
to print elements within a range, use [Start Index:End Index] and to print
whole List with the use of slicing operation, use [:].

Further, to print whole List in reverse order, use [::-1].

Note â€“ To print elements of List from rear end, use Negative Indexes.
