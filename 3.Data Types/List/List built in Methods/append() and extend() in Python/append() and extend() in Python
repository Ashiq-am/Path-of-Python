Append: Adds its argument as a single element to the end of a list. The length of the list increases by one.



syntax:
# Adds an object (a number, a string or a
# another list) at the end of my_list
my_list.append(object)










extend(): Iterates over its argument and adding each element to the list and extending the list.
         The length of the list increases by number of elements in itâ€™s argument.





syntax:
# Each element of an iterable gets appended
# to my_list
my_list.extend(iterable)













Time Complexity:

Append has constant time complexity i.e.,O(1).

Extend has time complexity of O(k). Where k is the length of list which need to be added.
