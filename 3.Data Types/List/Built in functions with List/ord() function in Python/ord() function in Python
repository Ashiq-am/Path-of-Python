Inbuilt ord() function in Python




Examples:

Input : a
Output : 97



Given a string of length one, return an integer representing the Unicode code point of the character when the
argument is a unicode object, or the value of the byte when the argument is an 8-bit string.

For example, ord(‘a’) returns the integer 97, ord(‘€’) (Euro sign) returns 8364.
This is the inverse of chr() for 8-bit strings and of unichr() for unicode objects.
If a unicode argument is given and Python was built with UCS2 Unicode, then the character’s code point must be
in the range [0..65535] inclusive.
