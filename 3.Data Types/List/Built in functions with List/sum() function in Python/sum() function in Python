Sum of numbers in the list is required everywhere. Python provide an inbuilt function sum() which sums up
the numbers in the list.





Syntax:

sum(iterable, start)



iterable : iterable can be anything list , tuples or dictionaries ,
 but most importantly it should be numbers.


start : this start is added to the sum of
numbers in the iterable.
If start is not given in the syntax , it is assumed to be 0.









Possible two syntaxes:


sum(a)
a is the list , it adds up all the numbers in the
list a and takes start to be 0, so returning
only the sum of the numbers in the list.



sum(a, start)
this returns the sum of the list + start
