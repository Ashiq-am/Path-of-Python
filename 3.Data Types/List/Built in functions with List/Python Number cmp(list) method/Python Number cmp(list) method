cmp(list) is a method specified in Number in Python 2.


The comparison of integral numbers have been discussed using cmp(). But many a times, there is a need to compare
the entire list that can be composed of similar or different data types.

In this case, different case scenarios occur and having knowledge of them can at times prove to be quite handy.


This function takes 2 lists as input and checks if the first argument list is greater, equal or smaller than
the second argument list.





Syntax : cmp(list1, list2)




Parameters :

list1 : The first argument list to be compared.
list2 : The second argument list to be compared.





Returns : This function returns 1, if first list is “greater” than second list, -1 if first list is smaller
          than the second list else it returns 0 if both the lists are equal.
