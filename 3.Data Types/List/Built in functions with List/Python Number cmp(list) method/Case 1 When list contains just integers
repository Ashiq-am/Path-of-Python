This is the case when all the elements in the list are of type integers and hence when comparison is made,
the number by number comparison is done left to right, if we get a larger number at any particular index,
we term it to be greater and stop the further comparisons.


If all the elements in both the list are similar and one list is larger(in size) than the other list,
larger list is considered to be greater.
