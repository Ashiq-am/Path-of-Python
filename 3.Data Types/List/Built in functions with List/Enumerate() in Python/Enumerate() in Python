A lot of times when dealing with iterators, we also get a need to keep a count of iterations.
Python eases the programmersâ€™ task by providing a built-in function enumerate() for this task.


Enumerate() method adds a counter to an iterable and returns it in a form of enumerate object.
This enumerate object can then be used directly in for loops or be converted into a list of tuples using list()
method.






Syntax:

enumerate(iterable, start=0)





Parameters:

*Iterable: any object that supports iteration

*Start: the index value from which the counter is
              to be started, by default it is 0
