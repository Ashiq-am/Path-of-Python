Like C++ sort(), Java sort() and other languages, python also provides built in function to sort.

The sort function can be used to sort the list in both ascending and descending order.







{To sort the list in ascending order.




Syntax

List_name.sort()
This will sort the given list in ascending order.}






{To sort the list in descending order.

Syntax

list_name.sort(reverse=True)
This will sort the given list in descending order.


Syntax :

list_name.sort() – it sorts in ascending order
list_name.sort(reverse=True) – it sorts in descending order
list_name.sort(key=…, reverse=…) – it sorts according to user’s choice




Parameters:
By default, sort() doesn’t require any extra parameters. However, it has two optional parameters:

reverse – If true, the list is sorted in descending order
key – function that serves as a key for the sort comparison




Return value:

It returns a sorted list according to the passed parameter.}
