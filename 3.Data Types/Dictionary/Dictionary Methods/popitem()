Generating a random number has many application in daily life. In a list, various functions are supported for the same.
A whole library is dedicated in Python to handle random numbers.

But sometimes, we need to perform a similar task with a dictionary.

popitem() method in dictionary helps to achieve similar purpose. It removes the arbitrary key-value pair from
the dictionary and returns it as a tuple.

There is an update for this method from Python version 3.7 onwards that it removes the last inserted
key-value pair from the dictionary and returns it as a tuple.








Syntax : dict.popitem()



Parameters : None



Returns : A tuple containing the arbitrary key-value pair from dictionary. That pair is removed from dictionary.
