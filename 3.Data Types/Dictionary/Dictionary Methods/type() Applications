type() function is basically used for debugging purposes. When used other string functions like .upper(), .lower(),
.split() with text extracted from a web crawler, it might not work because they might be of different type
which doesnâ€™t support string functions. And as a result it will keep throwing errors,
which are very difficult to debug [Consider the error as : GeneratorType has no attribute lower() ] .

type() function can be used at that point to determine the type of text extracted and then change it to other
forms of string before we use string functions or any other operations on it.





type() with three arguments can be used to dynamically initialize classes or existing classes with attributes.
It is also used to register database tables with SQL.
