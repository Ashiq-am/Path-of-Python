Union of two given sets is the smallest set which contains all the elements of both the sets.
Union of two given sets A and B is a set which consists of all the elements of A and all the elements
of B such that no element is repeated.




Input:Let set A = {2, 4, 5, 6}
      and set B = {4, 6, 7, 8}
Output: {2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}



Explanation: Taking every element of both the sets A and B,
             without repeating any element, we get a
             new set = {2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}.This new set
             contains all the elements of set A and all the elements
             of set B with no repetition of elements and is
             named as union of set A and B.






Syntax:

set1.union(set2, set3, set4….)
In parameters, any number of sets can be given






Return value:

The union() function returns a set, which has the union of all sets(set1, set2, set3…) with set1.
It returns a copy of set1 only if no parameter is passed.






Practical applications:

In most of the probability problems, the concept of union of sets is needed.
