In this article, we will see how to remove an element in a set, using the discard() and remove() method.
We will also learn the difference between the two methods, although both of them produce the same results.




Examples:

Input : set = ([10, 20, 26, 41, 54, 20])
Output : {41, 10, 26, 54}

Input : set = (["ram", "aakash", "kaushik", "anand", "prashant"])
Output : {'ram', 'prashant', 'kaushik', 'anand'}






                                     Method 1: Use of discard() method

The built-in method, discard() in Python, removes the element from the set only if the element is present
in the set. If the element is not present in the set,
then no error or exception is raised and the original set is printed.








                                       Method 2: Use of remove() method

The built-in method, remove() in Python, removes the element from the set only if the element is present
in the set, just as the discard() method does but If the element is not present in the set,
then an error or exception is raised.
