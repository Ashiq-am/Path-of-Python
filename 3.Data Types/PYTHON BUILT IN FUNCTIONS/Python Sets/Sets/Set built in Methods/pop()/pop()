This in-built function of Python helps to pop out elements from a set just like the principal used in
the concept while implementing Stack.
This method removes a random element from the set and returns the removed element.
Unlike, a stack a random element is popped off the set.



Syntax:

# Pops a random element from S
# and returns it.
S.pop()




This is one of the basic functions of the set and accepts no arguments. The return value is the popped
element from the set.
Once the element is popped out of the set, the set loses the element and it is updated to a set without
the element.




Examples:

Input :
sets = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
Output :
1
Updated set is {2, 3, 4, 5}

Input :
sets = {"ram", "rahim", "ajay", "rishav", "aakash"}
Output :
rahim
Updated set is {'ram', 'rishav', 'ajay', 'aakash'}
