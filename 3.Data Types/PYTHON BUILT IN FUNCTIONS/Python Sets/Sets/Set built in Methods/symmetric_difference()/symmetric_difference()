This in-built function of Python Set helps us to get the symmetric difference between two sets,
which is equal to the elements present in either of the two sets,
but not common to both the sets. Letâ€™s look at the Venn diagram of the symmetric_difference between two sets.






If there are a set_A and set_B, then the symmetric difference between them will be equal to the union of
set_A and set_B without the intersection between the two.







// Takes a single parameter that has to be
// a set and returns a new set which is the
// symmetric difference between the two sets.
set_A.symmetric_difference(set_B)







Examples:

Input: set_A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
       set_B = {6, 7, 3, 9, 4}
Output :  {1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9}
Explanation: The common elements {3, 4}
are discarded from the output.

Input:
set_A = {"ram", "rahim", "ajay", "rishav", "aakash"}
set_B = {"aakash", "ajay", "shyam", "ram", "ravi"}
Output: {"rahim", "rishav", "shyam", "ravi"}

Explanation: The common elements {"ram", "ajay",
"aakash"} are discarded from the final set
