Two sets are said to be disjoint when their intersection is null. In simple words they do not have any
common element in between them.




Examples:

Let set A = {2, 4, 5, 6}
and set B = {7, 8, 9, 10}

set A and set B are said to be be disjoint sets as their
intersection is null. They do-not have any common elements in between them.







Syntax:

set1.isdisjoint(set2)









Parameters:

The isdisjoint() method takes only a single argument.
It can also take an iterable (list, tuple, dictionary and string) to disjoint(). The isdisjoint() method
will automatically convert iterables to set and checks whether the sets are disjoint or not.









Return Value:

returns Trueif the two sets are disjoint.
returns Falseif the twos sets are not disjoint.
