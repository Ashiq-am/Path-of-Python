Difference between two sets in Python is equal to the difference between the number of elements in two sets. The function difference() returns a set that is the difference between two sets. Let’s try to find out what will be the difference between two sets A and B. Then (set A – set B) will be the elements present in set A but not in B and (set B – set A) will be the elements present in set B but not in set A.





Example:

set A = {10, 20, 30, 40, 80}
set B = {100, 30, 80, 40, 60}

set A - set B = {10, 20}
set B - set A = {100, 60}

Explanation: A - B is equal to the elements present in A but not in B
             B - A is equal to the elements present in B but not in A








Syntax:

set_A.difference(set_B) for (A - B)
set _B.difference(set_A) for (B - A)
