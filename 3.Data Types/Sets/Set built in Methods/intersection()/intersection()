Intersection of two given sets is the largest set which contains all the elements that are common to both
the sets.
Intersection of two given sets A and B is a set which consists of all the elements which are common to
both A and B.





Input: Let set A = {2, 4, 5, 6}
       and set B = {4, 6, 7, 8}
Output: {4,6}

Explanation: Taking the common elements in both the sets,
             we get {4,6} as the intersection of both the sets.







Syntax:

set1.intersection(set2, set3, set4….)
In parameters, any number of sets can be given









Return value:

The intersection() function returns a set, which has the intersection of all sets(set1, set2, set3…)
with set1.
It returns a copy of set1 only if no parameter is passed.







Practical applications:
In most of the probability problems, the concept of intersection of sets is needed.
