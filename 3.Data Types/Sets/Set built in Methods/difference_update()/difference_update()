The difference_update() method helps in an in-place way of differentiating the set.
The previously discussed set difference() helps to find out the difference between two sets and returns
a new set with the difference value, but the difference_update() updates the existing caller set.



If A and B are two sets. The set difference() method will get the (A – B) and will return a new set.
The set difference_update() method modifies the existing set.
If (A – B) is performed, then A gets modified into (A – B), and if (B – A) is performed,
then B gets modfied into (B – A).






Syntax:

A.difference_update(B) for (A - B)
B.difference_update(A) for (B - A)






The function returns None and changes the value of the existing set.
