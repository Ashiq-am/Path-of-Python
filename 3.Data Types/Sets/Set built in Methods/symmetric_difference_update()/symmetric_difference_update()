The symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the sets but not in
both of them.




symmetric_difference() method returns a new set which contains symmetric difference of two sets.
The symmetric_difference_update() method updates the set calling symmetric_difference_update() with
the symmetric difference of sets.







Syntax:
A.symmetric_difference_update(B)







Parameters:
The symmetric_difference takes a single “set” as a argument.







Returns:
This method returns None (which indicates absence of a return value). It only updates the set calling
symmetric_difference_update() with the symmetric difference of sets.
