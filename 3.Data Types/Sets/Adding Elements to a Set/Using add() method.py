"""Elements can be added to the Set by using built-in add() function.
Only one element at a time can be added to the set by using add() method,
loops are used to add multiple elements at a time with the use of add() method.

Note â€“ Lists cannot be added to a set as elements because Lists are not hashable whereas Tuples can be
added because tuples are immutable and hence Hashable."""
