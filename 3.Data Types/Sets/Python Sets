In Python, Set is an unordered collection of data type that is iterable, mutable and has no
duplicate elements.The order of elements in a set is undefined though it may consist of
various elements.


The major advantage of using a set, as opposed to a list,is that it has a highly optimized method
for checking whether a specific element is contained in the set.
