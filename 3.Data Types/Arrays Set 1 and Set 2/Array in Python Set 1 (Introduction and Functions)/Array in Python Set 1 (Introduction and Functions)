Other than some generic containers like list, Python in its definition can also handle containers with specified data types.
Array can be handled in python by module named “array“.
They can be useful when we have to manipulate only a specific data type values.



Operations on Array :

1. array(data type, value list) :- This function is used to create an array with data type and value list specified in its arguments.
Some of the data types are mentioned in the table below.



TYPE CODE	              C TYPE	                     PYTHON TYPE	                        MINIMUM SIZE IN BYTES
‘b’	                    signed char	                         int	                                      1
‘B’	                   unsigned char	                     int	                                      1

‘L’	                   unsigned long	                     int	                                      4
‘q’	                  signed long long	                     int	                                      8

2. append() :- This function is used to add the value mentioned in its arguments at the end of the array.

3. insert(i,x) :- This function is used to add the value at the position specified in its argument.

4. pop() :- This function removes the element at the position mentioned in its argument, and returns it.

5. remove() :- This function is used to remove the first occurrence of the value mentioned in its arguments.

6. index() :- This function returns the index of the first occurrence of value mentioned in arguments.

7. reverse() :- This function reverses the array.
