sorted() function has an optional parameter called ‘key’ which takes a function as its value.
This key function transforms each element before sorting, it takes the value and returns 1 value which is then
used within sort instead of the original value.



For example, if we pass a list of strings in sorted(), it gets sorted alphabetically . But if we specify
key = len, i.e. give len function as key, then the strings would be passed to len,
and the value it returns, i.e. the length of strings will be sorted.

Which means that the strings would be sorted based on their lengths instead
