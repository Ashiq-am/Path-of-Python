Sorting any sequence is very easy in Python using built-in method sorted() which does all the hard work for you.

Sorted() sorts any sequence (list, tuple) and always returns a list with the elements in sorted manner,
without modifying the original sequence.








Syntax : sorted(iterable, key, reverse)





{Parameters : sorted takes three parameters from which two are optional.



***Iterable : sequence (list, tuple, string) or collection (dictionary, set, frozenset) or any other iterator that
           needs to be sorted.



***Key(optional) : A function that would server as a key or a basis of sort comparison.


***Reverse(optional) : If set true, then the iterable would be sorted in reverse (descending)
                    order, by default it is set as false.}
