Now you might be thinking how coroutine is different from threads, both seems to do same job.
In case of threads, it’s operating system (or run time environment)
that switches between threads according to the scheduler.

While in case of coroutine, it’s the programmer and programming language which decides when to switch coroutines.

Coroutines work cooperatively multi task by suspending and resuming at set points by programmer.
