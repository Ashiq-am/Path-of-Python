To define a class method in python, we use @classmethod decorator and to define a static method we use @staticmethod decorator.
Let us look at an example to understand the difference between both of them.
Let us say we want to create a class Person.
Now, python doesnâ€™t support method overloading like C++ or Java so we use class methods to create factory methods.
In the below example we use a class method to create a person object from birth year.

As explained above we use static methods to create utility functions.
In the below example we use a static method to check if a person is adult or not.
