While writing a code, there might be a need for some specific modules.
So we import those modules by using a single line code in Python.

But what if the name of the module needed is known to us only during runtime?
How can we import that module? One can use the Pythonâ€™s inbuilt __import__() function.
It helps to import modules in runtime also.




Syntax: __import__(name, globals, locals, fromlist, level)




Parameters:

name : Name of the module to be imported

globals and locals : Interpret names

formlist : Objects or submodules to be imported (as a list)

level : Specifies whether to use absolute or relative imports. Default is -1(absolute and relative).
