range() : Python range function generates a list of numbers which are generally used
in many situation for iteration as in for loop or in many other cases.

In python range objects are not iterators. range is a class of a list of immutable objects.

The iteration behavior of range is similar to iteration behavior of list in list and range
we can not directly call next function.

We can call next if we get an iterator using iter.







range does not generates all numbers that it contains when we create it.
It gives only those numbers which we get them using loop. range has following properties.

1.range objects are immutable means that they can not be changed again so they can be used as index in dictionaries.

2.They have start stop and step arguments .

3.same range can be visit again and again
