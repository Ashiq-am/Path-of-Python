In Python, anonymous function means that a function is without a name.
As we already know that def keyword is used to define the normal functions and the lambda keyword is
used to create anonymous functions. It has the following syntax:



lambda arguments: expression



1.This function can have any number of arguments but only one expression, which is evaluated and returned.

2.One is free to use lambda functions wherever function objects are required.

3.You need to keep in your knowledge that lambda functions are syntactically restricted to a single expression.

4.It has various uses in particular fields of programming besides other types of expressions in functions.









1.Without using Lambda : Here, both of them returns the cube of a given number.
But, while using def, we needed to define a function with a name cube and needed to pass a value to it.
After execution, we also needed to return the result from where the function was called using the return keyword.


2.Using Lambda : Lambda definition does not include a “return” statement, it always contains an expression
which is returned. We can also put a lambda definition anywhere a function is expected,
and we don’t have to assign it to a variable at all. This is the simplicity of lambda functions.



Lambda functions can be used along with built-in functions like filter(), map() and reduce().
