In Python, we can return multiple values from a function. Following are different ways

1) Using Object: This is similar to C/C++ and Java,
we can create a class (in C, struct) to hold multiple values and return an object of the class.


2) Using Tuple: A Tuple is a comma separated sequence of items.
It is created with or without (). Tuples are immutable. See this for details of tuple and list.


3) Using a list: A list is like an array of items created using square brackets.
They are different from arrays as they can contain items of different types. Lists are different from tuples as they are mutable.


4) Using a Dictionary: A Dictionary is similar to hash or map in other languages. See this for details of dictionary.
