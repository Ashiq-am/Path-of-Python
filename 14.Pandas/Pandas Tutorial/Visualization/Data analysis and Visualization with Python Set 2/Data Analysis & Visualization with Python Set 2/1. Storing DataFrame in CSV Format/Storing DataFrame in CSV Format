Pandas provide to.csv('filename', index = "False|True") function to write DataFrame into a CSV file.
Here filename is the name of the CSV file that you want to create and index tells that index (if Default) of
DataFrame should be overwritten or not.

If we set index = False then the index is not overwritten. By Default value of index is TRUE then index is overwritten.
