Important features of this code:



data = {'api_dev_key':API_KEY,
        'api_option':'paste',
        'api_paste_code':source_code,
        'api_paste_format':'python'}





Here again, we will need to pass some data to API server. We store this data as a dictionary.

r = requests.post(url = API_ENDPOINT, data = data)






Here we create a response object ‘r’ which will store the request-response.
We use requests.post() method since we are sending a POST request.
The two arguments we pass are url and the data dictionary.


pastebin_url = r.text




In response, the server processes the data sent to it and sends the pastebin URL of your source_code which
can be simply accessed by r.text .








requests.post method could be used for many other tasks as well like filling and submitting the web forms, posting
on your FB timeline using the Facebook Graph API, etc.
