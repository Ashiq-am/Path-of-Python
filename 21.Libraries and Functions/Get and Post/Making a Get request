Important points to infer :

PARAMS = {'address':location}




The URL for a GET request generally carries some parameters with it. For requests library,
parameters can be defined as a dictionary.
These parameters are later parsed down and added to the base url or the api-endpoint.
To understand the parameters role, try to print r.url after the response object is created.
You will see something like this:



http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=delhi+technological+university







This is the actual URL on which GET request is made


r = requests.get(url = URL, params = PARAMS)







Here we create a response object ‘r’ which will store the request-response.
We use requests.get() method since we are sending a GET request.
The two arguments we pass are url and the parameters dictionary.


data = r.json()




Now, in order to retrieve the data from the response object, we need to convert the raw response content into
a JSON type data structure.
This is achieved by using json() method. Finally, we extract the required information by parsing down the
JSON type object.
