This post discusses two HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) request methods  GET and POST requests in Python
and theirimplementation in python.




What is HTTP?

HTTP is a set of protocols designed to enable communication between clients and servers.
It works as a request-response protocol between a client and server.
A web browser may be the client, and an application on a computer that hosts a web site may be the server.

So, to request a response from the server, there are mainly two methods:

*GET : to request data from the server.
*POST : to submit data to be processed to the server.


Here is a simple diagram which explains the basic concept of GET and POST methods.











Now, to make HTTP requests in python, we can use several HTTP libraries like:

httplib
urllib
requests



The most elegant and simplest of above listed libraries is Requests.
We will be using requests library in this article.
To download and install Requests library, use following command:



pip install requests
