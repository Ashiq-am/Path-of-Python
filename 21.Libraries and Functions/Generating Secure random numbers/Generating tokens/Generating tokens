This module provides several functions for generating secure tokens for applications such as password resets,
hard-to-guess URLs etc.






1.secrets.token_bytes([nbytes=None]) : This function is responsible for generating a random byte string containing
                                      nbytes number of bytes. If no value is provided, a reasonable default is used.








2.secrets.token_hex([nbytes=None]) : This function is responsible for generating a random text string in hexadecimal
                               containing nbytes random bytes. If no value is provided, a reasonable default is used.









3.secrets.token_urlsafe([nbytes=None]) : This function is responsible for generating a random URL-safe text string
                                  containing nbytes random bytes. This is suitable for password recovery applications.












How many bytes should tokens use?
At least 32 bytes for tokens should be used to be secure against a brute-force attack.
