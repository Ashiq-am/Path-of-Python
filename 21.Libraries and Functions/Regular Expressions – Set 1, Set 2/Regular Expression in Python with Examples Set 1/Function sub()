Syntax:\
    re.sub(pattern, repl, string, count=0, flags=0)



"""The ‘sub’ in the function stands for SubString, a certain regular expression pattern is searched in the given
string(3rd parameter), and upon finding the substring pattern is replaced by repl(2nd parameter),
count checks and maintains the number of times this occurs."""
