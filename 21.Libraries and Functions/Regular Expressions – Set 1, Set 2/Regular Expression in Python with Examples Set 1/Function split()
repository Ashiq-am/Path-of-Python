Split string by the occurrences of a character or a pattern, upon finding that pattern,
the remaining characters from the string are returned as part of the resulting list.


Syntax :

re.split(pattern, string, maxsplit=0, flags=0)



The First parameter, pattern denotes the regular expression, string is the given string in which pattern will
be searched for and in which splitting occurs, maxsplit if not provided is considered to be zero ‘0’,
and if any nonzero value is provided, then at most that many splits occurs.


If maxsplit = 1, then the string will split once only, resulting in a list of length 2.
The flags are very useful and can help to shorten code,
they are not necessary parameters, eg: flags = re.IGNORECASE, In this split, case will be ignored.
