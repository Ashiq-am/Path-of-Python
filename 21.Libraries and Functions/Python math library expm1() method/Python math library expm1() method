Python has math library and has many functions regarding to it. One such function is expm1().
This function mathematically computes the value of exp(x) - 1.
This method can be used if we need to compute this very value.



Syntax : math.expm1()



Parameters :
x : Number whose exp(x)-1 has to be computed.


Returns : Returns the computed value of “exp(x)-1”
