This module is used for matching Unix shell-style wildcards. fnmatch() compares a single file name against a
pattern and returns TRUE if they match else returns FALSE.
The comparison is case-sensitive when the operating system uses a case-sensitive file system.

The special characters and their functions used in shell-style wildcards are :

1.‘*’ – matches everything

2.‘?’ – matches any single character

3.‘[seq]’ – matches any character in seq

4.‘[!seq]’ – matches any character not in seq



The meta-characters should be wrapped in brackets for a literal match. For example, ‘[?]’ matches the character ‘?’.
