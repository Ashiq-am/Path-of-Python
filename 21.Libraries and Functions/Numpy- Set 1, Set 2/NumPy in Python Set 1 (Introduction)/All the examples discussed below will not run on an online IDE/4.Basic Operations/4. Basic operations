Plethora of built-in arithmetic functions are provided in NumPy.




***Operations on single array: We can use overloaded arithmetic operators to do element-wise operation on array
                               to create a new array.
                               In case of +=, -=, *= operators, the exsisting array is modified.




***Unary operators: Many unary operations are provided as a method of ndarray class.
                    This includes sum, min, max, etc.
                    These functions can also be applied row-wise or column-wise by setting an axis parameter.







***Binary operators: These operations apply on array elementwise and a new array is created.
                     You can use all basic arithmetic operators like +, -, /, , etc.
                     In case of +=, -=, = operators, the exsisting array is modified.








***Universal functions (ufunc): NumPy provides familiar mathematical functions such as sin, cos, exp, etc.
                             These functions also operate elementwise on an array, producing an array as output.
