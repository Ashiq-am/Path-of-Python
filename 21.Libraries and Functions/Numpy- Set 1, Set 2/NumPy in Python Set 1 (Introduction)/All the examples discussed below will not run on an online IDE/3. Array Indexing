Knowing the basics of array indexing is important for analysing and manipulating the array object.
NumPy offers many ways to do array indexing.



***Slicing: Just like lists in python, NumPy arrays can be sliced. As arrays can be multidimensional,
            you need to specify a slice for each dimension of the array.




***Integer array indexing: In this method, lists are passed for indexing for each dimension.
                          One to one mapping of corresponding elements is done to construct a new arbitrary array.




***Boolean array indexing: This method is used when we want to pick elements from array which satisfy some
                           condition.
