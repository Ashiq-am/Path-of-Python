NumPy’s main object is the homogeneous multidimensional array.

*It is a table of elements (usually numbers), all of the same type, indexed by a tuple of positive integers.

*In NumPy dimensions are called axes. The number of axes is rank.

*NumPy’s array class is called ndarray. It is also known by the alias array.





Example :

[[ 1, 2, 3],
 [ 4, 2, 5]]
Here,
rank = 2 (as it is 2-dimensional or it has 2 axes)
first dimension(axis) length = 2, second dimension has length = 3
overall shape can be expressed as: (2, 3)
