Theano is a Python library that allows us to evaluate mathematical operations including multi-dimensional
arrays so efficiently. It is mostly used in building Deep Learning Projects.

It works a way more faster on Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) rather than on CPU.
Theano attains high speeds that gives a tough competition to C implementations for problems involving large amounts
of data.

It can take advantage of GPUs which makes it perform better than C on a CPU by considerable orders of
magnitude under some certain circumstances.


It knows how to take structures and convert them into very efficient code that uses numpy and some native libraries.
It is mainly designed to handle the types of computation required for large neural network algorithms used in
Deep Learning. That is why, it is a very popular library in the field of Deep Learning.









How to install Theano :

pip install theano



Several of the symbols we will need to use are in the tensor subpackage of Theano.
We often import such packages with a handy name, letâ€™s say, T.




from theano import *
import theano.tensor as T
