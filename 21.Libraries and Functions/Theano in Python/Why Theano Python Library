Theano is a sort of hybrid between numpy and sympy, an attempt is made to combine the two into one powerful
library. Some advantages of theano are as folows:




1.Stability Optimization: Theano can find out some unstable expressions and can use more stable means
                          to evaluate them




2.Execution Speed Optimization: As mentioned earlier, theano can make use of recent GPUs and execute parts
                                of expressions in your CPU or GPU, making it much faster than Python





3.Symbolic Differentiation: Theano is smart enough to automatically create symbolic graphs for computing gradients
