The purpose of Bisect algorithm is to find a position in list where an element needs to be inserted to keep the
list sorted.

Python in its definition provides the bisect algorithms using the module “bisect” which allows to keep the
list in sorted order after insertion of each element. This is essential as this reduces overhead time required
to sort the list again and again after insertion of each element.
