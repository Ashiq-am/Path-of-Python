Matplotlib is an amazing visualization library in Python for 2D plots of arrays.
Matplotlib is a multi-platform data visualization library built on NumPy arrays and designed to work with the
broader SciPy stack. It was introduced by John Hunter in the year 2002.


One of the greatest benefits of visualization is that it allows us visual access to huge amounts of data in
easily digestible visuals. Matplotlib consists of several plots like line, bar, scatter, histogram etc.


Ticks are the values used to show specific points on the coordinate axis. It can be a number or a string.
Whenever we plot a graph, the axes adjust and take the default ticks.
Matplotlib’s default ticks are generally sufficient in common situations but are in no way optimal for every plot.
Here, we will see how to customize these ticks as per our need.
