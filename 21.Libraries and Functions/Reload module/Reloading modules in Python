reload() reloads a previously imported module. This is useful if you have edited the module source file
using an external editor and want to try out the new version without leaving the Python interpreter.

The return value is the module object.

Note: The argument should be a module which has been successfully imported.




Usage:




*For Python2.x

reload(module)





*For above 2.x and <=Python3.3

import imp
imp.reload(module)





*For >=Python3.4

import importlib
importlib.reload(module)
