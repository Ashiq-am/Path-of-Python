This example shows how to modify pickling behavior for a class. The TextReader class opens a text file,
and returns the line number and line contents each time its readline() method is called.



1.If a TextReader instance is pickled, all attributes except the file object member are saved.


2.When the instance is unpickled, the file is reopened, and reading resumes from the last location.
