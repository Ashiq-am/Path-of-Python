The pickle module is used for implementing binary protocols for serializing and de-serializing a Python
object structure.



*Pickling: It is a process where a Python object hierarchy is converted into a byte stream.

*Unpickling: It is the inverse of Pickling process where a byte stream is converted into an object hierarchy.




Module Interface :

*dumps() – This function is called to serialize an object hierarchy.

*loads() – This function is called to de-serialize a data stream.



For more control over serialization and de-serialization, Pickler or an Unpickler objects are created respectively.
