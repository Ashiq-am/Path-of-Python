qrtools contains a class QR (can be viewed in the source code), for which we must initially create an object.
The object takes the following arguments

1.data

2.pixel_size

3.level

4.margin_size

5.data_type


To create a QR code with default settings, we must simply specify the data while creating the object.
Note that the data must be a unicode object if non-ASCII objects are going to be used.
