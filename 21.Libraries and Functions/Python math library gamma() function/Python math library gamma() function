Python in its language allows various mathematical operations, which has manifolds application in scientific domain.

One such offering of Python is the inbuilt gamma() function, which numerically computes the gamma value
of the number that is passed in the function.




Syntax : math.gamma(x)



Parameters :
x : The number whose gamma value needs to be computed.




Returns : The gamma value, which is numerically equal to “factorial(x-1)”.
