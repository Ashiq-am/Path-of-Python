Developer often wants a user to enter multiple values or inputs in one line.
In C++/C user can take multiple inputs in one line using scanf but in
Python user can take multiple values or inputs in one line by two methods.

Using split() method
Using List comprehension






Using split() method :
This function helps in getting a multiple inputs from user .
It breaks the given input by the specified separator.
If separator is not provided then any white space is a separator.
Generally, user use a split() method to split a Python string but one can used it in taking multiple input.


Syntax :

input().split(separator, maxsplit)







Using List comprehension :
List comprehension is an elegant way to define and create list in Python.
We can create lists just like mathematical statements in one line only.
It is also used in getting multiple inputs from a user.
