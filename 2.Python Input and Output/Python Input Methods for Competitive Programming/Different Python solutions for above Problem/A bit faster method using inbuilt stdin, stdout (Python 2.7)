1. sys.stdin on the other hand is a File Object. It is like creating any other file object one could create
to read input from the file. In this case, the file will be standard input buffer.

2. stdout.write(‘D\n’) is faster than print ‘D’.

3. Even faster is to write all once by stdout.write(“”.join(list-comprehension)) but this makes memory
usage dependent on size of input.
