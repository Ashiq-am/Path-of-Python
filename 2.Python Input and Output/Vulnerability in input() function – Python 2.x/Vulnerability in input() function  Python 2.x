This article aims at explaining and exploring the vulnerability in the input() function in Python 2.x.
In Python 3, the raw_input() function was erased, and itâ€™s functionality was transferred to a new built-in function
known as input().



                                              Ways to input data in Python 2.x

There are two common methods to receive input in Python 2.x:




1.Using the input() function: This function takes the value and type of the input you enter as it is without modifying
any type.

2.Using the raw_input() function : This function explicitly converts the input you give to type string,
