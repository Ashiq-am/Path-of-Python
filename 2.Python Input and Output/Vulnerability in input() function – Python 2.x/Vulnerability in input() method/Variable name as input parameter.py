"""As it can be seen, in second case the variable “secret_number” can be directly given as input and answer is always “You won”. 
It evaluates the variable as if a number was directly entered, by which means it returns a True Boolean always. 
Using raw_input, it would not be possible as it disallows to read the variable directly."""
