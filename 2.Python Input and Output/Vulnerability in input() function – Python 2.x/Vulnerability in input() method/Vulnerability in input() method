The vulnerability in input() method lies in the fact that the variable accessing the value of input can be
accessed by anyone just by using the name of variable or method.





1.Variable name as input parameter:

The variable having the value of input variable is able to access the value of the input variable directly.



2.Function name as parameter: The vulnerability lies here as we can even provide the name of a function
as input and access values that are otherwise not meant to be accessed.






                                                      Preventing input vulnerabilities

It is always better to use raw_input() in python 2.x and then explicitly convert the input to whatever
type we require.

For example, if we wish to take input of an integer, we can do the following



n = int(raw_input())



This prevents the malicious calling or evaluation of functions.
