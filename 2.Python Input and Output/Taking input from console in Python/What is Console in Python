Console (also called Shell) is basically a command line interpreter that takes input from the user i.e one command
at a time and interprets it. If it is error free then it runs the command and gives required output otherwise
shows the error message.


Here we write command and to execute the command just press enter key and your command will be interpreted.
For coding in Python you must know the basics of the console used in Python.


The primary prompt of the python console is the three greater than symbols

>>>


You are free to write the next command on the shell only when after executing the first command these prompts
have appeared.

The Python Console accepts command in Python which you write after the prompt.
