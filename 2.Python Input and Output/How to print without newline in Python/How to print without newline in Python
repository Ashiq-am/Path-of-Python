Generally people switching from C/C++ to Python wonder how to print two or more variables or statements without
going into a new line in python.

Since the python print() function by default ends with newline.
Python has a predefined format if you use print(a_variable) then it will go to next line automatically.




But sometime it may happen that we donâ€™t want to go to next line but want to print on the same line.
So what we can do?





For Example:




Input : print("geeks") print("geeksforgeeks")
Output : geeks geeksforgeeks

Input : a = [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output : 1 2 3 4




The solution discussed here is totally dependent on the python version you are using.
