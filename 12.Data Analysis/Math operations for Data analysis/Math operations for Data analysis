Python is a great language for doing data analysis, primarily because of the fantastic ecosystem of data-centric
Python packages. Pandas is one of those packages, and makes importing and analyzing data much easier.

There are some important math operations that can be performed on a pandas series to simplify data analysis using
Python and save a lot of time.




s=read_csv("stock.csv", squeeze=True)
#reading csv file and making seires







FUNCTION	                                                USE

s.sum()	                                  Returns sum of all values in the series

s.mean()	                    Returns mean of all values in series. Equals to s.sum()/s.count()


s.std()	                               Returns standard deviation of all values

s.min() or s.max()	                   Return min and max values from series

s.idxmin() or s.idxmax()	          Returns index of min or max value in series

s.median()	                                   Returns median of all value

s.mode()	                                   Returns mode of the series

s.value_counts()	                    Returns series with frequency of each value

s.describe()	              Returns a series with information like mean, mode etc depending on dtype of data passed
