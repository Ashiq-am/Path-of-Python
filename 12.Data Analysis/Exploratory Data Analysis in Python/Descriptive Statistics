1.Descriptive statistics is a helpful way to understand characteristics of your data and to get a quick summary of it.
Pandas in python provide an interesting method describe(). The describe function applies basic statistical
computations on the dataset like extreme values, count of data points standard deviation etc.

Any missing value or NaN value is automatically skipped. describe() function gives a good picture of
distribution of data.








2.Another useful method if value_counts() which can get count of each category in a categorical attributed series
of values. For an instance suppose you are dealing with a dataset of customers who are divided as youth,
medium and old categories under column name age and your dataframe is “DF”.
You can run this statement to know how many people fall in respective categories.
In our data set example education column can be used







3.One more useful tool is boxplot which you can use through matplotlib module. Boxplot is a pictorial representation
of distribution of data which shows extreme values, median and quartiles.
We can easily figure out outliers by using boxplots.
Now consider the dataset we’ve been dealing with again and lets draw a boxplot on attribute population
