ANOVA stands for Analysis of Variance. It is performed to figure out the relation between the different group of
categorical data.

Under ANOVA we have two measures as result:

– F-testscore : which shows the variaton of groups mean over variation
– p-value: it shows the importance of the result


This can be performed using python module scipy method name f_oneway()


Syntax:


import scipy.stats as st
st.f_oneway(sample1, sample2, ..)



These samples are sample measurements for each group.
As a conclusion, we can say that there is a strong correlation between other variables and a categorical variable
if the ANOVA test gives us a large F-test value and a small p-value.
