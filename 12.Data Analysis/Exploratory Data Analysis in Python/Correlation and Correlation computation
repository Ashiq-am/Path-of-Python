Correlation is a simple relationship between two variables in a context such that one variable affects the other.
Correlation is different from act of causing.
One way to calculate correlation among variables is to find Pearson correlation.
Here we find two parameters namely, Pearson coefficient and p-value.
We can say there is a strong correlation between two variables when Pearson correlation coefficient is close to
either 1 or -1 and the p-value is less than 0.0001.
Scipy module also provides a method to perform pearson correlation analysis,



syntax:

import scipy.stats as st
st.pearsonr(sample1, sample2)
