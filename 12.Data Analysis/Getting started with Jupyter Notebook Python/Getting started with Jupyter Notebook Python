The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain
live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text.
Uses include data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization,
machine learning, and much more.


Jupyter has support for over 40 different programming languages and Python is one of them.
Python is a requirement (Python 3.3 or greater, or Python 2.7) for installing the Jupyter Notebook itself.
