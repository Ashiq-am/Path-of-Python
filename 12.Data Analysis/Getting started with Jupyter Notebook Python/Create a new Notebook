Now on the dashboard, you can see a new button at the top right corner. Click it to open a drop-down list and
then if you’ll click on Python3, it will open a new notebook.





Few Useful Commands:

1.Command to open a notebook in the currently running notebook server.

             jupyter notebook notebook_name.ipynb





2.By default, the notebook server starts on port 8888. If port 8888 is unavailable or in use, the notebook server
searches the next available port. You may also specify a port manually. In this example, we set the server’s port
to 9999:

                       jupyter notebook --port 9999





3.Command to start the notebook server without opening a web browser:

                 jupyter notebook --no-browser




4.The notebook server provides help messages for other command line arguments using the –help flag:

                  jupyter notebook --help
