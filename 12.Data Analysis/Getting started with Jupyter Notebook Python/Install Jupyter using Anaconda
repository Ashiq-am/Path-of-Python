commonly used packages for scientific computing and data science.
You can download Anacondaâ€™s latest Python3 version from here.Now, install the downloaded version of Anaconda.



Installing Jupyter Notebook using PIP:

python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install jupyter



Command to run the Jupyter notebook:

jupyter notebook






This will print some information about the notebook server in your terminal, including the URL of the web application
(by default, http://localhost:8888) and then open your default web browser to this URL.
When the notebook opens in your browser, you will see the Notebook Dashboard, which will show a list of the notebooks,
files, and subdirectories in the directory where the notebook server was started.
Most of the time, you will wish to start a notebook server in the highest level directory containing notebooks.
Often this will be your home directory.
