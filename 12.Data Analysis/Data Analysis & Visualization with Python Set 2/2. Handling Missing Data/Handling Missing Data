The Data Analysis Phase also comprises of the ability to handle the missing data from our dataset, and not so
surprisingly Pandas live up to that expectation as well.

This is where dropna and/or fillna methods comes into the play.
While dealing with the missing data, you as a Data Analyst are either supposed to drop the column containing the
NaN values (dropna method) or fill in the missing data with mean or mode of the whole column entry (fillna method),
this decision is of great significance and depends upon the data and the affect would create in our results.
